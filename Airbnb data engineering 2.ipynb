There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix.

If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)</td><td>F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park.

There is an awesome Tenement Museum now on Orchard street, not far from my apartment. The Lower East Side has, in my opinion, two identities. The eastern side is very residential. The western, more in part is a hip, night time destinations with many bars, restaurants, galleries, cafes, independent shops, etc. My apartment is a couple of minutes from the hip part.  My particular street is very much in transition definitely going through gentrification. My block has now three renovated buildings, including mine and I suspect in a few years, will be completely different.  My immediate neighborhood is a mix of people - a real reflection of NYC diversity - Asian, Latin, Jewish, Black, young professionals, hipsters, artists, etc. It's a cool mix.

If you expect perfection, it's best you book a hotel. :)</td><td>F train, East Broadway stop is seconds away, very convenient and per my reviews, one of the things people love about my place.  The East Broadway stop is the last stop in Manhattan before it heads to Dumbo in Brooklyn The F train also goes up the center of Manhattan and can take you to the East Village, Soho, West Village, Chelsea, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the southern part of Central Park.

It still has a bit of graffiti and grit and is full of vibrant ethnic enclaves but is very safe and you simply won't find a younger, funner place in NYC. The apartment is steps to great restaurants (probably the best in the city), bars (definitely the best in the city), cafes, and anything else you could want.  Within a few minutes' walk you'll find: a huge arcade bar, a whiskey-slash-grilled-cheese bar, the most famous steakhouse in the country, dirt-cheap dives, incredible speakeasy cocktail bars, and the best pizza place in NYC.</td><td>Please have a great time! And even though the area is lively and a lot of fun, the apartment itself is VERY quiet, in case that's a concern. Oh, and it's a walk-up/no elevator. All guests must be able to climb stairs with their bags. Same day guests must message me before Instant Booking to confirm availability, and checkin may be later than the listed time if we can make it work. Through Spring of 2020, the L train (nearest subway) will be undergoing long-term maintenance, resulting in slightly longer waits late at night and on weekends. The trains will still be running (the \"L Train Shutdown\" you may have heard about was actually canceled), and should be operating normally on weekdays, making the impact minimal to non-existant. Still, guests should be aware of this!</td><td>The subway (L train) is literally around the corner (you don't even need to cross the street) and is quick and very safe—even late at night. You can get just about anywhere in the city in minutes. Union Square is about 10 minutes away, the East Village about 7 minutes. It really is about as convenient a location as you'll find for getting around.  We also have several CitiBike bike-share stations within steps of the building. For $10 a day (or a longer-term subscription), you get unlimited access to these bikes, parked throughout the entire city.  The neighborhood itself is also very walkable, with tons to do, eat, shop, and drink in the immediate vicinity. Be like the locals and walk!</td><td>Guests have access to an enormous and beautiful apartment in a great part of town, steps from the subway. Your private room has a private balcony, and is on a completely separate floor from where I sleep (meaning tons of privacy). You have your own bathroom, access to the kitchen, living room, and pretty much whatever else you like. You can come and go as you please, 24 hours a day, and you won't disturb me. I also offer free laundry with overnight drop-off service for guests staying at least six nights.</td><td>That's up to you! If you'd rather I didn't exist, I understand. If you want to grab a beer and talk about your trip and getting the most out of NYC, I'm happy to (assuming I'm not slammed with work)! There are also occasions when I have to travel at the last minute. So if I have to skip town for work, I apologize, and hope you enjoy the private apartment!</td><td>-All guests must read the full listing (particularly the sections labeled \"The Space\" and \"Other things to note\") BEFORE booking. You may need to click a button to expand the text, but please do so. You'll see why I ask at the end (there's a bit of a code phrase in there.) Beyond that, it's all pretty much common sense! -Even if Instant Book is on, please read the entire listing before booking and message me that all looks good. You'll see why I ask at the end! (And please don't be surprised there are stairs!) -Before booking, please fill out your profile and add a real photo!

We've been renting out our house on Airbnb for many years now and enjoy meeting the people and families who stay here.</td><td>within a day</td><td>100%</td><td>50%</td><td>f</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/d102cfbb-edb4-4409-916e-e79df9287ed6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/d102cfbb-edb4-4409-916e-e79df9287ed6.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Gowanus</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Brooklyn, NY, United States</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Gowanus</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>NY</td><td>11217</td><td>New York</td><td>Brooklyn, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.68157</td><td>-73.98989</td><td>t</td><td>Townhouse</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>6</td><td>2.0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Paid parking off premises\",\"Free street parking\",\"Indoor fireplace\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",Washer,Dryer,\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"First aid kit\",\"Safety card\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"24-hour check-in\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50\",\"Self check-in\",Lockbox,\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\"}</td><td>null</td><td>$200.00</td><td>$1,800.00</td><td>null</td><td>$300.00</td><td>$100.00</td><td>5</td><td>$50.00</td><td>30</td><td>66</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>66</td><td>66</td><td>30.0</td><td>66.0</td><td>2 months ago</td><td>t</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>64</td><td>2020-02-13T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>20</td><td>1</td><td>2011-07-14T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>2019-07-30T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>98</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.19</td></tr><tr><td>26362</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/26362</td><td>20200212052319</td><td>2020-02-12T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>Times Square, Safe, Clean and Cozy!</td><td>Confortable and cozy.

Cleaning (but clean up after yourself when using common areas) WiFi + Cable TV  Fresh linens + towels Breakfast Stuff (coffee/tea, bread, juice, etc.) This is for a bedrooms in a Duplex apartment in the East Village. Perfect for 2 cou</td><td>none</td><td>If you like food and drink, the East Village is the place to be! With over 400 places to eat and drink, all within walking distance, it will be hard for you to not gain weight while visiting. My belly size is proof of all the good food nearby and I'm happy to recommend my favorite places!</td><td>To avoid the corrupt government being bought by the hotel lobbies, I've kept it legal and compliant by sharing my space with travelers.</td><td>Walking is the safest and easiest way to get around. Subways are close, all within 10 minute walk in different directions. You can get a bus on the block that will bring you to subway in 5 minutes. Outside of work rush hours, you can always get a taxi in the corner. It takes me 20-25 minutes to get to the Empire State Building in midtown whether I walk, jump in a cab or take the subway. If I have time to kill, I'll take a his, as they take longer than anything for long travels, but great to get to a subway quickly if it's raining.</td><td>Guests have access to every room / space in the apartment.</td><td>I meet all guests for check in to give you key(s), show you around, info in the building + neighborhood and answer any questions you may have. You'll rarely see me due to my crazy, traveling work schedule.</td><td>No children. If you have children, please look at my \"BEST WESTON - East Village\" listing.  Please keep noise down after midnight during the week. There are full time resident neighbors who live here permanently and work Monday thru Friday.  Clean kitchen after use. Should you be inclined to use your culinary skills, it is required you leave the kitchen as you find it. There is a dishwasher (a.k.a. a dirty dish storage unit) to put the stuff you use after you eat or drink. If you break something, you bought it. Check out is 12 Noon to 3 PM. Extra charges may apply if late checkout. Guests who are brought over and stay the night may be subject to $ 25 extra person fee.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/70133ece-9f15-45db-bbb5-086d9c6af7b2.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>72062</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/72062</td><td>Bruce</td><td>2010-01-20T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>New York, New York, United States</td><td>Update February 2014 - After 3 great years of success renting out rooms in my apartment, I suggest just shooting me a message and let me know your dates, the make up of your party (singles/couples/kids/grand peeps, sorry no pets) and any special needs you may desire.

You can see a map in my photos.</td><td>You have access to your bedroom, living room, all bathrooms, kitchen and the backyard.</td><td>I will be sharing the apartment with you and will be available to answer any questions.</td><td>My rules are simple: • Please note every human in your group must be included in the guest numbers so I don't exceed my maximum capacity of 4 people.  I do not have a 'children stay free' policy. Every person in your group must be included in the guest numbers regardless of age. My policy is that guests of any age are charged the same. Therefore Airbnb's system will not calculate the correct guest numbers and accommodation fee when they're under 2's included. To manually override this, enter children under 2 as though they were in the 2-12 category. This will make sure you know exactly what you'll be charged BEFORE you book. • No pets - sorry fido has to stay home • No parties, no outside visitors or overnight guests without previous approval from your host. • Do not engage in illegal activities anywhere on the property. • If you break or damage something, please let me know and arrange for its replacement or repair. • Do not leave any food out that will attract uninvited pests.

I am a working mother and artist who lives in one of the best neighborhoods in New York City with my teenaged son, Idriys, and our adorable toy poodle, Chester.  We have been offering our properties since 2010 in NYC and since 2013 in Washington DC. I manage the property in DC for my big sister, Khadijah, who is an attorney and interior designer. She lives in the attached house there. While I will handle all of your arrangements beforehand, I am based in NYC. Upon arrival, Khadijah will be your host in Washington DC.\n\nIn NYC, you will meet me, Idriys, and Chester. I am an actor/writer/director who is now beginning to study music. My son, Idriys, is my favorite thing. He loves art, sports, literature and music and is extremely good with small children (and animals) if you ever need a babysitter. We are a well traveled family having visited several countries on every continent except Australia (next stop :)). Idriys is studying Spanish and Mandarin in school , and I am picking up a bit of each myself. We adopted our pup Chester in May 2015. He is a sweet dog who loves people and animals. He is very well-behaved and gives us and our guests love but also space. He's very cool, no begging or barking and very well-mannered. The perfect dog for us! In addition to travel we love good food, art, good people, and hosting! What started out as a financial endeavor has turned out to be so much more. Through this business, we have met the loveliest people from all over the world many of whom have become people we truly consider friends. Its not unusual that our guests wind up inviting us to see a show, share a meal, or to explore the city with them. What a wonderful way to make a living by providing a peaceful environment, good energy, and a home away from home to people during their travels. We hope to do the same for you!</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>75%</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/0a4088d9-9c25-421a-808f-2921f1668300.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba', 'work_email']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>Brooklyn, NY, United States</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Clinton Hill</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>Brooklyn</td><td>NY</td><td>11238</td><td>New York</td><td>Brooklyn, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.6863</td><td>-73.96765</td><td>t</td><td>Condominium</td><td>Private room</td><td>3</td><td>1.5</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{TV,\"Cable TV\",Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Pets allowed\",\"Pets live on this property\",\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Smoke detector\",\"Carbon monoxide detector\",\"Fire extinguisher\",Essentials,Shampoo,\"Lock on bedroom door\",Hangers,\"Hair dryer\",Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Private living room\",Bathtub,\"Children’s books and toys\",\"Pack ’n Play/travel crib\",\"Hot water\",\"Bed linens\",\"Extra pillows and blankets\",\"Coffee maker\",Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Oven,Stove,\"EV charger\",\"BBQ grill\",\"Garden or backyard\",\"Luggage dropoff allowed\",\"Long term stays allowed\",Other,\"Shower gel\",\"Trash can\"}</td><td>550</td><td>$135.00</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>$250.00</td><td>$90.00</td><td>2</td><td>$40.00</td><td>4</td><td>730</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>730</td><td>730</td><td>4.0</td><td>730.0</td><td>4 months ago</td><td>t</td><td>30</td><td>60</td><td>90</td><td>365</td><td>2020-02-13T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>91</td><td>13</td><td>2010-08-07T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>2020-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>97</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0.78</td></tr><tr><td>32289</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/32289</td><td>20200212052319</td><td>2020-02-13T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>Sun-drenched, artsy modernist 1 BDRM duplex</td><td>This North Williamsburg duplex is wonderfully situated (a view of the Manhattan skyline sparkling behind neighborhood rooftops ) and cozy, comfortable and unique.

Karen A small, cozy and quiet bedroom with queen size bed in a 900 sq ft (84M2) sun filled treetop 2 bedroom West Village apartment overlooking Christopher Park with beautiful views and chef's kitchen complete with dishwasher, microwave, gas stove. French doors to Juliet balcony, Wifi, Cable TV, DVD, CD, working fireplace. A/C &/or fans. 5th floor with elevator. Great access to all public transportation. Private Room with access to the entire apartment. Mi casa es su casa! You have a friend in NYC.  I'll be happy to help in any way I can. Rig</td><td>none</td><td>Right in the heart of the Village. Across the street from the Duplex, Jazz club Bar 55, The Stonewall with The Monster up the block. 2 blocks from Bleecker Street's great shopping and Washington Square Park. Surrounded by cafes and restaurants... from fabulous dives to the trendiest restaurants. Close to the Meatpacking District, High Line, Chelsea, Union Square, Nolita, Soho and East Village. 1 block from the 6th, 7th & 8th Avenue subway lines and buses to everywhere.</td><td>I live here with Rookie ... a loving 18 year old Abyssinian cat.</td><td>Public transportation links from airports to Manhattan and back again below:  Airlink is the least expensive and a great way to go except if you have a lot of luggage. If traveling by subway... get out at the West 4th Street station There is an elevator from the platform to the street but if you choose to walk it's only about 12 steps. The local 1 train is also very close to the apt.

I just ask that you smoke on the balcony (or near it with the french doors open) so the apartment is smell and smoke free for non smoking guests. Thank you! Please make sure the cats are locked in when entering and exiting the apartment. You need to be comfortable with cats. It won't work for any of us if you have any issues. They're extremely loving and gentle and enjoy getting to know the guests (almost) as much as I do. And at 17 yrs old their used to drinking water from the bathroom faucet at times... and sleep much more than they used to.</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/200208/f9c2e5c9_original.jpg?aki_policy=large</td><td>null</td><td>120291</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/120291</td><td>Karen</td><td>2010-05-07T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>New York, New York, United States</td><td>I love to travel and to meet new people, whether on the road or at home.

I'm in Marketing and I travel a lot for work. \n\nI've been living in New York for many years, but am always in awe when go, for instance to Times Square. To simply stand there, looking at those billboards, lights... I always try to count how many \"televisions\" there are but I always loose count... There are whole buildings that are televisions.. It's just fascinating!\n\nFor the more relaxed times I *love* my charming neighborhood... In the Lower East Side (LES) things are calmer... There are tree-lined, European-like narrow streets, lovely coffee-shops, restaurants with tables on the streets... bars with live music... lots of green gardens, flowers, families with kids, hip, young professionals, and *lots* of amazing little places, restaurants, bakeries, boutiques, theaters, cinemas. That's why I chose to live here. \n\nIt's a super-super safe, area, even late at night, I'm totally comfortable waking around at 2 or 3am - it's very intellectual, bohemian and artistic. \n\nIt's one of the most \"happening\" neighborhoods, \nas well as SOHO and the Meatpacking. \n\nEveryone loves the Lower East Side - take a look at my reviews. \nIf you come to visit you'll see what I mean! :-)\n\nHere is the AirBnB page for the Lower East Side:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/locations/new-york/lower-east-side</td><td>within a few hours</td><td>100%</td><td>91%</td><td>t</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/282927/profile_pic/1357372148/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small</td><td>https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/282927/profile_pic/1357372148/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium</td><td>Lower East Side</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>New York, NY, United States</td><td>Manhattan</td><td>Lower East Side</td><td>Manhattan</td><td>New York</td><td>NY</td><td>10002</td><td>New York</td><td>New York, NY</td><td>US</td><td>United States</td><td>40.72052</td><td>-73.98589</td><td>t</td><td>Apartment</td><td>Entire home/apt</td><td>2</td><td>1.0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Real Bed</td><td>{Internet,Wifi,\"Air conditioning\",Kitchen,\"Paid parking off premises\",\"Free street parking\",\"Buzzer/wireless intercom\",Heating,\"Family/kid friendly\",\"Smoke detector\",Essentials,Hangers,Iron,\"Laptop friendly workspace\",\"Hot water\",Refrigerator,\"Dishes and silverware\",\"Cooking basics\",Stove,\"Long term stays allowed\",Other}</td><td>null</td><td>$150.00</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>$500.00</td><td>$130.00</td><td>2</td><td>$20.00</td><td>3</td><td>90</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>90</td><td>90</td><td>3.0</td><td>90.0</td><td>a week ago</td><td>t</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>136</td><td>2020-02-12T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>55</td><td>14</td><td>2010-12-27T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>2020-01-19T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>93</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>f</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>f</td><td>f</td><td>strict_14_with_grace_period</td><td>t</td><td>t</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.49</td></tr><tr><td>59121</td><td>https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/59121</td><td>20200212052319</td><td>2020-02-13T00:00:00.000+0000</td><td>Nice, clean, safe, convenient 3BR</td><td>null</td><td>3 bedroom/1bathroom brownstone apartment. 3 Blocks to the train to Manhattan and 25 minutes to the city.

On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud.

The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor.

My husband and I are both sensitive to cats and it finally caught up with us the last evening/morning of staying. The room was perfect for what we needed because we spent most of our time in the city. Only thing I wished the room had was a full length mirror so I could see my outfits better for our evenings.

The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.

The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more.

We thought Shun was friendly but very reserved .Bottom line: great location, close to places of interest (we practically walked everywhere), clean but basic accommodation, however, don't expect a social, interactive host because once you've checked-in, you're on your own! Not an unpleasant experience overall.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>154880</td><td>2010-12-17</td><td>172204</td><td>Bernard</td><td>Great stay at Shun's apartment.

Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.  I would say location-wise and room needs this was a decent place.</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>188631</td><td>2011-02-26</td><td>285023</td><td>Manon</td><td>It was a perfect location.

Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan.

I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel.

It's only a few blocks away from the Columbus Circle subway station, which is right next to Central Park. One block south is an NYPD station, so the neighborhood is fairly safe. Around the corner is Mariella's Pizza, which I highly recommend. There are several 24 hour stores in the area for your convenience. The room is very spacious and is perfect for one person, but it can accommodate two people comfortably. The mini fridge was very useful and the air conditioner worked adequately, especially during summer.  The bathroom was clean and functional and towels were provided. I stayed here for a whole week and actually saw Shunichi only one time and waved hello, so I had my privacy the entire time of my stay. I really enjoyed my stay here.

J'ai beaucoup hésité pour la note entre 3 et 4 mais finalement j'ai tranché sur un 3 et je m'explique tout de suite. Tout d'abord parlons des points positifs : - l'appartement a une situation idéale, à 5 min de Central Park, à 10 minutes de Time Square. Le top ! On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>126408979</td><td>2017-01-11</td><td>108364416</td><td>Justine</td><td>I stayed for one night to see a concert a Terminal 5 (just a 10 minute walk down the street) so the location was perfect.

The host was barely visible so you don't have to worry about him being in the way. We didn't get to use the kitchen but we never asked either so we don't know if it wasn't allowed at all. Overall, the location is great. There are a couple of subways, restaurants and markets to buy breakfast nearby. Not far from Times Square and Broadway.

Además de la ubicación, tienes absoluta privacidad, a veces no sabes si Shunichi está en casa, entras y sales sin problema. La cama esta muy bien y las sabanas estaban limpias. La ducha no estaba limpísima pero las he visto mucho peores, es aceptable ducharse ahí si piensas en lo barato del alojamiento y el sitio en el q está. Si vas a New York para estar todo el dia en la calle, y pasar el tiempo justo en el alojamiento para dormir descansar y ducharte es una opcion barata que te gustará. Yo repetiría! No es apto para príncipes y princesas pero estás en pleno Manhattan por muy poco dinero. Shunichi es agradable y muy escueto, tuvimos un problema con una llave y lo solucionó rapidamente.

The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal.

Lo más importante del apartamento es que está muy bien situado (entre Central Park y Times Square). Si no eres muy escrupuloso por lo del baño (y te llevas unas chanclas), en general está bien para lo que pagas.

The air conditioner wouldn't work and we couldn't figure out for the life of us why, until my fiance decided to open it up and found 2 inches of dust in the filter which we proceeded to clean.  The place cooled down nice after that but cleaning up other people's air conditioners wasn't what we wanted to be doing.  3)  The pictures are misleading.

It's perfect if you enjoy walking, great food, and central park.  We walked around the city all day and then came back for dinner in hells kitchen.  You can find every type of food imaginable, within a block or two of the apartment.  And Kate was great at communicating with us, even though she was out of town.  That being said, there were a few inconveniences we had to deal with during our stay.  Since Kate was not home we had the added bonus of privacy, but when we arrived we had to buzz a neighbor to let us into the building.  Another guest had just left the apartment, and with Kate out of town the bathroom wasn't clean and the drains were clogged.  But my husband was able to unclog the drains and clean.  I contacted Kate about this and she very considerately offered to give a $50 rebate which we appreciated.  Also, there is an unfortunate elderly neighbor across the hall who often leaves his door open and the smell of urine fills the hall.  The elderly neighbor also plays his television too loud in the middle of the night, but my husband asked him to turn it down and he did.  All in all it was a great trip, just be prepared to deal with a few obstacles.</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>19728546</td><td>2014-09-17</td><td>3671547</td><td>Guido</td><td>\"We had a great zip of NYC, thanks to Kate's cosy and perfectly situated apt!

It's in a perfect location with especially easy access to the Broadway theaters and the Bryant Park area (I was in town to use the NYPL).  The room is spotlessly clean, very comfortable, and because it's tucked away from the street, quiet.  Kate herself is an incredibly kind, friendly, and extremely helpful host.  She's ready with any directions and recommendations you might need.  I really enjoyed getting to know her.  I hope we cross paths again!</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>75094077</td><td>2016-05-18</td><td>8005023</td><td>Jose</td><td>As advertised, the room is small but it is enough for a couple (more than 3 suitcases can be challenging maybe) to sleep and visit the city.  The location is perfect, really close to Times Square, the underground is nearby and easy to reach all the important places to visit. Kate is really friendly and always willing to help if you need it. She didn't have any problems with us leaving our luggage in the apartment until the time to go to the airport, for instance. I definitely recommend this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>75675204</td><td>2016-05-22</td><td>66908700</td><td>Lionel</td><td>Kate is awesome! she was very kind and helpful.

Very quiet and safe place to stay. I very much appreciated the extra effort made to help me navigate my way from JFK to Manhattan. Kate was so great to provide me several options (with prices and necessary specific directions) which made arriving to a very busy city quite manageable.  As long as people are willing to go up 5 flights of stairs (which was fine with me) and share a bathroom (which was never a scheduling problem), then I'd recommend this booking. It's centrally located, easy to find, and most importantly safe and quiet.  Kate, was a gracious host.

In general, she was a very responsive host. The apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and cozy. The five flights of stairs makes this a challenging location for anyone with large or heavy luggage. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Manhattan, especially people who want to sample the restaurants of Hell's Kitchen. </td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>88749236</td><td>2016-07-25</td><td>83619221</td><td>Neil</td><td>Kate took the initiative to send us ground transportation directions to make sure we made to her place easily.

Uma vez lá nos recebeu com muita gentileza, tínhamos tudo dentro do apartamento a nossa disposição. Ela passou ótimas dicas de lugares para comer segundo o que estávamos procurando e algumas outras boas dicas de como economizar um pouco em ingressos para alguns lugares turísticos como museus e coisas do tipo. A comunicação sempre foi fluente e ela sempre se assegurou que eu tivesse todas as informações que precisava. O apartamento é pequeno mas aconchegante e está a poucas quadras do time square e das maiores atrações turísticas de NY. Saímos a noite sem problema nenhum na questão de segurança.

I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud.

The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>3831</td><td>107304979</td><td>2016-10-09</td><td>21232644</td><td>Steve</td><td>\"Super great location for our needs\n3831,107843460,2016-10-12,2708447,Sandy,\"Lisa was Awesome and her place was Great.

Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!

The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again.

Shun was very flexible accomodating me as I was later than expected due to travel complications.  He waited at the apartment to receive me.  He even grabbed my bags up to the second floor. The main entrance is a small hallway that leads to the two rooms. If you a tad bit alergic to dust , you should not stay here.  Otherwise, the room is very large, with a small working fridge, microwave and lots of channels for cable.  This kitchen is a bit odd to use since it is in the host's living area and you would be separated by a glass door.  If you are there for a short stay then eating out and buying things that can be reheated would work best.  Although, Shun said that if I needed a cup or plate from the kitchen I was free to use which was nice of him.  The hosts were very quiet all weekend I really didn't see them.  Although, if I needed something I'm sure I could have asked.

Anyway, first appearances of the building might be scary for some. It is rather run down. Indeed, the apartment must not have enough storage space because there are boxes lining the hallway leading to the main part of the apartment. The room is very basic, but is as advertised. There is a small refrigerator, some dishes and a microwave, a TV and WiFi. The apartment could use a cosmetic facelift, for sure, but apart from that, it was comfortable enough, though spartan.

I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>8620543</td><td>2013-11-09</td><td>4508112</td><td>Paul</td><td>Great location, perfect sized room, friendly host & environment in general.

Anyone who hasn't been to Manhattan the place is easy to get around to all tourist attractions via the subway. $31 for a 7-day MetroCard with unlimited train & bus use.

Which goes to show that the room faces a quiet street and that the bed is comfortable, even if a metal frame.  The room is as it looks in the photo, with the additions of a table cloth, cups, mugs and a small mirror, without the plant, stool and dark full length curtain, now replaced by a shorter one that lets the light through it.  Shunichi was very communicative about my move in and had no problem with me coming earlier than I initially indicated,nor with me leaving my luggage at his place until I left the city the following day.

On était à proximité de tout : de boutiques souvenirs, de restaurants, de fast-foods, de Columbus Circle où on peut faire ses courses facilement, bref parfait ! - la chambre est vraiment spacieuse (avec mon amie on s'est vraiment étalé, et oui on est des filles :p, mais on était vraiment à l’aise) et des équipements à dispo un frigo, un micro-onde, de la vaisselle, une TV (un peu sensible avec l'antenne), un Wi-Fi un peu capricieux parfois avec notre ordinateur, quelques nécessaires de toilette, des plans de NY à dispo... - la cuisine est à dispo et à tout ce qu'il faut pour se cuisiner des repas rapides (cela change des fast-foods à gogo :)) - la salle de bain est spacieuse également. Pas de petite salle de bain toute riquiqui, non il y a de la place dans la douche, pour se préparer, pour utiliser le lavabo… Mais malheureusement il y a quand même quelques points négatifs à retenir et pas des moindres comme : - la propreté en général. Nous ne sommes pas regardantes avec mon amie sur 2-3 poils qui pourraient se trouver dans une douche ou un grain de poussière dans l'appartement. Mais là c'était vraiment très limite, sans parler de la vétusté de l'appart, la salle de bain était vraiment borderline avec des poils, des cheveux, de la poussière par terre, le lavabo n'était pas nettoyé, je doute que le tapis soit lavé par exemple aussi. Et dans la cuisine, la plaque de gaz était grasse, noire de saleté... Dans la chambre, on aurait apprécié des draps propres entre ces deux semaines, le sol n’était pas vraiment propre, et le frigo n’était pas nettoyé. Bref nous étions vraiment déçues par rapport à cela. Et je reprécise que pourtant nous ne sommes pas difficiles en règle générale. - la salle de bain. En plus d'être très vieille (des barres de douche rouillées, des murs moisis, une vieille plomberie), prendre une douche était vraiment un calvaire. Une fois brûlante et une fois glacée, on arrivait à régler l'eau une fois sur 10. Et autant dire que c'est frustrant de pas pouvoir prendre une douche correcte quand on a marché toute la journée et qu'on est crevé. Enfin dernier point, plutôt mitigé - la communication avec l’hôte. Alors certes l’hôte est très discret et pour des gens comme moi qui préfère cela aux personnes envahissantes, c’était parfait. Néanmoins mon amie a regretté le fait de ne pas avoir parfois des infos, des recommandations (nous nous ne sommes même pas souhaités la bonne année, c’est quand même dommage quand deux...</td></tr><tr><td>5178</td><td>126408979</td><td>2017-01-11</td><td>108364416</td><td>Justine</td><td>I stayed for one night to see a concert a Terminal 5 (just a 10 minute walk down the street) so the location was perfect.

If you want spotless living quarters, get a fancy hotel. Shunichi provided a comfortable room with a tv, DVD player(remote needs batteries), Small fridge, microwave oven, and other appliances such as a toaster, etc. There is also a closet and a shelf-system that is perfect for your clothes. Shunichi was very prompt in replying to texts when I got to town and near his residence. He helped me carry my luggage up the 1 flight of stairs and when I made an inquiry about salt, he was at my door within 2 minutes. And that was all I saw of my host the entire week.

For one person, the bed may work, but for a couple the bed is not good at all because there is a giant hole in the middle of it that you kind of sink into.  2)  The air conditioner.  The air conditioner wouldn't work and we couldn't figure out for the life of us why, until my fiance decided to open it up and found 2 inches of dust in the filter which we proceeded to clean.  The place cooled down nice after that but cleaning up other people's air conditioners wasn't what we wanted to be doing.  3)  The pictures are misleading.

A few drawbacks worth mentioning when paying around £800 for the stay: a) pictures are somewhat missleading-the flat is VERY dark, almost no natural light so not suitable for staying in during the day, b) shower does not drain properly (which seems to be quite a frequent problem judging by the reviews) and toilet kept on blocking (Ben was responsive to this though), c) no cable TV though it is advertised and the Netflix subscription ran out on the second day of our stay so had to swich to our own - not a big deal but probably shouldn't happen when paying quite a lot of money for the stay. Overall, it was an okay stay (we only really slept in the flat and the flat was clean) but next time we would book something cheaper in Brooklyn as it is only one stop away from this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>5238</td><td>226435423</td><td>2018-01-10</td><td>131235148</td><td>Catherine</td><td>Ben’s place is great!

It's a small one bedroom, 5th floor walk up in a great location.  It's right on the border of the theater district and hell's kitchen.  It's perfect if you enjoy walking, great food, and central park.  We walked around the city all day and then came back for dinner in hells kitchen.  You can find every type of food imaginable, within a block or two of the apartment.  And Kate was great at communicating with us, even though she was out of town.  That being said, there were a few inconveniences we had to deal with during our stay.  Since Kate was not home we had the added bonus of privacy, but when we arrived we had to buzz a neighbor to let us into the building.  Another guest had just left the apartment, and with Kate out of town the bathroom wasn't clean and the drains were clogged.  But my husband was able to unclog the drains and clean.  I contacted Kate about this and she very considerately offered to give a $50 rebate which we appreciated.  Also, there is an unfortunate elderly neighbor across the hall who often leaves his door open and the smell of urine fills the hall.  The elderly neighbor also plays his television too loud in the middle of the night, but my husband asked him to turn it down and he did.  All in all it was a great trip, just be prepared to deal with a few obstacles.</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>19728546</td><td>2014-09-17</td><td>3671547</td><td>Guido</td><td>\"We had a great zip of NYC, thanks to Kate's cosy and perfectly situated apt!

If it was not for Kate, this trip would have not been nearly as amazing as it was. Great location, great host, best airbnb experience for me yet!!</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>142901567</td><td>2017-04-09</td><td>100800747</td><td>John</td><td>Great location, flexibility, and helpful tips from Kate.</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>145867719</td><td>2017-04-20</td><td>11319688</td><td>Chona</td><td>Kate is a person with a lot of knowledge about the city. She is very hospitable and very generous. She provided us with a simple and yet delicious breakfast. Her place is very accessible to the most attractions in New York. Almost everything is walkable. Her place is safe and secure. Her place is also near restaurants, shopping mall, supermarkets, etc. You can find anything that you need. If you are looking for a budget place, her place is the answer to your need. But it is only good for 2 people. My only comment is that, what appears in the photos are not exactly accurate.</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>149719335</td><td>2017-05-05</td><td>52358671</td><td>Andre</td><td>The apartment is simple, clean and quiet.

Ela foi uma ótima anfitriã! Desde o começo se preocupou em saber em qual aeroporto chegaríamos e assim que soube passou todas as informações para chegarmos no apartamento da forma mais fácil e econômica (indicando qual meio de transporte devíamos pegar, onde descer e o preço e ia costar!). Uma vez lá nos recebeu com muita gentileza, tínhamos tudo dentro do apartamento a nossa disposição. Ela passou ótimas dicas de lugares para comer segundo o que estávamos procurando e algumas outras boas dicas de como economizar um pouco em ingressos para alguns lugares turísticos como museus e coisas do tipo. A comunicação sempre foi fluente e ela sempre se assegurou que eu tivesse todas as informações que precisava. O apartamento é pequeno mas aconchegante e está a poucas quadras do time square e das maiores atrações turísticas de NY. Saímos a noite sem problema nenhum na questão de segurança. Em resumo: o apartamento da Kate é uma ótima opção para quem quer passar uns dias em NY e ter a melhor recepção!</td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>159055517</td><td>2017-06-09</td><td>115899361</td><td>Petra</td><td>Kate ist super nett und sehr hilfsbereit! Die Lage ist echt super, zu Fuss kann man alles erreichen! Es besteht auch die Möglichkeit die U-Bahn zu nutzen. Das Bett war sehr bequem, nur ist das Zimmer ein wenig klein. Was aber nicht so schlimm ist, da man nur dort schläft. Obwohl die Lage sehr zentral liegt, ist es Nachts ruhig, so dass man fast nichts hört. Wenn wir nach NYC kommen, dann würden wir definitiv wieder zu Kate!! Es ist absolut weiter zu empfehlen. Thank you Kate! </td></tr><tr><td>5441</td><td>162846382</td><td>2017-06-22</td><td>82908527</td><td>Ketan</td><td>Kate's place was perfect for discovering the city.

The location could not be better.  Very clean</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Jennifer is a gracious host with an amazing one of a kind space you won't find anywhere in Mid Manhattan.\n2595,207635137,2017-10-29,28067322,Yannick,\"Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.

Overall great stay and host was amazing!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lisa and her family were warm and welcoming hosts. The place was clean and we had all we wanted in the kitchen. We had a high speed internet and a good air conditioner. Personally, I loved the neighbourhood artistic. We had a nice experience.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lisa was great! Communication prior to the stay was good and Lisa made us feel welcome. The room is fine, spacious if spare but that  is clear from the pictures. There were a lot of thoughtful details as well, like spare toothbrushes, coffee, creamer etc. One of the things I was worried about in NYC was parking, and there was plenty of on street parking. There was a market on the corner. The house is currently being renovated so chances are you will find it even better when you go. My wife and I had a great time, she especially loved her surprise! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice apartment, good location. Very near to Subway, very nice host</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good time at LisaRoxannes house. The house is currently being renovated so the room is still fairly simple and undecorated. But the place is very clean and tidy, the bed sleeps wonderful and LisaRoxanne and her husband are wonderful people doing all they can to make you feel comfortable. Special plus for us: We had our one-and-a-half-year-old kid with us and that was no problem whatsoever. If you go to NYC, stay there - you are in the best hands!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>LisaRoxanne is a great host! We came about an hour and a half earlier than expected, and she was totally fine with that. She sent me suggestions for brunch near her place and also offered to help my friend find a good parking spot on the street. She is friendly and had everything we could have needed (towels, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair dryer, etc.) and offered to get us some bagels for breakfast. The kitchen has been recently renovated, and the bedroom was very comfortable and fit our needs exactly. Check in and out were both easy! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed staying at Lisa Roxanne's place. The place was spacious, clean, and easy to find. Lisa Roxanne was extremely accommodating, allowing us to store our bags before check-in time. The bed was very comfortable. It was a very good experience all around.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Had a wonderful time, very cosy and warm compared to the freezing temperatures outside.

It was also good to have enough space in the kitchen to cook and sit down to eat - we cooked a few times during our stay and the kitchen was simple but had the necessary utensils. Lisa was really helpful during the whole stay, with useful advice about public transport and even getting tickets for a Broadway show. It was overall a good experience!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Super séjour à Brooklyn. L'appartement est bien décrit et très propre.

Good room, good WiFi, no problems or anything to complain about at all.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at LisaRoxanne's place when we stayed for 3 nights in October. The apartment is relatively well located for the subway (less than 10 mins walk) and was equipped as shown in the pictures. Short walk to a few coffee shops/restaurants/bars. The living area had a good wifi connection, the bed was big and comfy and the bedroom was very spacious with A/C.  The only thing to bear in mind, as another reviewer has noted, is that even though the guest area occupies the whole of the top floor of the building there is no dividing wall or door for the area - other than the bedroom door.  This doesn't cause any major problems but it does mean that noise from the family living area below travels up the stairs more easily and has a feeling of the area not being completely private - although this was just a feeling as we had sole use of the top floor. LisaRoxanne was a friendly and responsive host before and during our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"A good space, in need of some tender loving care\n3831,113392479,2016-11-12,80187375,Makena,\"Great experience!

Lisa is very helpful. She recommends a good restaurant to us and print NBA match tickets for us. Highly recommend.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Perfect spot for us this long weekend. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but when we were there it was just fine! The bed is comfortable and all the linens were clean. There are some thin curtains that work for privacy and do block some night street light, but not all. The apartment was clean and had all the amenities we needed. It was very quiet and we didn't see anyone except when we checked in. Private enough for us. We heard people occasionally - the family has some kids - but it was just normal living noises. The check-in was flexible. The location is good in terms of being accessible to Brooklyn and Manhatten. It was easy to get anywhere by car (or transit). We were able to get to Prospect Park very easily and it is close to transit lines, although we didn't use transit as we had our dog. The neighbourhood was pretty quiet and felt safe. Close to Clinton Hill. Great to be dog friendly for us! Would stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"We stayed 4 days at LisaRoxanne's house and it was a very good time.\n3831,135566583,2017-03-05,73698537,David,\"This is a great place to stay in Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"LisaRoxanne was a warm and inviting host.

We were awakened at 2am when the family came home, then again around 6:30am when the kids were playing in their play area and getting ready for school.

Shun is a gracious and unobtrusive host.  He even offered to connect his extra laptop for me to have web access to look up theater times, museum info, etc.  The microwave, refrigerator, and flat panel TV (with cable) are all great amenities.  The street noise is really no big deal considering the very, very convenient 2nd floor location.  The noise is typical for New York.  Bring ear plugs and a sleeping pill if you really want to be assured a good night's sleep.  (Shun and Akiko, here is my one important suggestion:  Go to IKEA or Bed, Bath & Beyond (or even JCPenney) and get a set of matching sheets, duvet / comforter cover and 2-4 matching pillows and pillowcases.  The sheets,  and especially the pillows,  were sub-standard even at your very competitive rate.  If you do this, you would definitely earn 5-stars from me!  Thanks again for a fantastic stay overall!  You guys were wonderful!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My three nights at the 55th Street room were perfect.  Shun met me as soon as I arrived on his doorstep. He showed me in and left me alone.  He seemed to understand from the moment I got there what I wanted and needed.  The room is clean and comfortable.  The down comforter and flat screen were more than I ever expected.  The tea and cocoa were perfect for the times I came in for a rest from my long walks on the sidewalks of my favorite city. The apartment is just three blocks from Columbus Circle,  and just a few blocks to the Theatre District.  There are good places to eat very near by. The bakery around the corner on Eighth Ave was very good and Luigi’s Pizza across the avenue was a favorite of my teenage son’s last time we were there as a family.  I was able to live like a New Yorker for those three days and it was exactly what I needed.  I will definitely stay with Shun and Akiko again when I come to NYC. I recommend this accommodation to anyone who wants to experience living in NYC, not just visiting.  I know this neighborhood well, having lived there in the 80’s, and I could not have asked for more. It was like being home, only a lot better, because I was unfettered and able to do exactly what I wanted.  I can’t wait to go back again.

The apartment is none too cozy, but it is big and very private and you have everything in it you need (Wifi, dishes, fridge etc) and by the way, you will hardly find an accommodation in this area which offers you all this and still is affordable.

I was in NYC for only 3 days and 2 nights which meant i had to do a lot of running around and the location certainly helped. The apartment is located a couple of blocks south of central park and the subway station and a few blocks north of times square which made for great travelling times to all parts of the city. The apartment itself was nothing special. All the amenities were as described in the website except for an air conditioner, which i obviously did not need as i was visiting in winter. The room looked a bit worn down and probably needed a paint job. Some people here commented that the toilet was dirty but that was not the case. The apartment and toilet was a bit worn down but by no means dirty. Keep in mind that you are renting an apartment and not a luxury hotel. It is certainly good value for money and a great place to stay for a couple of days. Last but not the least, the host was very polite and friendly and i didn't get to see him much except while checking in and checking out. So, my honest assessment and recommendation is this- If you are looking for luxury and great comfort, then go to a luxury hotel. But if you want value for money, great location and a new yorker feeling stay at shunichi's, you'll not regret it!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"L'appartamento è situato in una posizione davvero comoda: tra time square e central park, al primo piano di una tranquilla palazzina , abbiamo trovato un appartamentino davvero confortevole, la nostra stanza era servita da ogni confort.\n5178,8945867,2013-11-27,337193,Michaël & Céline,A very well-situated apartment several blocks away from Central Park\n5178,9078190,2013-12-05,4892465,Ben,The photo gives a better image of the room than what it is.

The room is located four doors from the Soup Man and a 10 min walk to Times Square and 5 min walk to Central Park. Meals are best had outside the room at any of the many nearby diners and restaurants. Great breakfast at Cosmic Diner.  The shared bathroom was not a problem and the water was hot.

Though it was very hot and hard to sleep, Shunichi provided us with another air con and it worked well. The bathroom had some stains, grime and mold. There were old curtains but it got the job done. The bedroom was dusty and dark but the bed was a good size and the host/host's friend provided us more blankets and pillows if needed. Overall, for the price and location, it's definitely a steal.

For one person, the bed may work, but for a couple the bed is not good at all because there is a giant hole in the middle of it that you kind of sink into.  2)  The air conditioner.  The air conditioner wouldn't work and we couldn't figure out for the life of us why, until my fiance decided to open it up and found 2 inches of dust in the filter which we proceeded to clean.  The place cooled down nice after that but cleaning up other people's air conditioners wasn't what we wanted to be doing.  3)  The pictures are misleading.

The location is great, walking distance to the Financial District, Brooklyn bridge and Little Italy, Soho, Noho, etc, and the subway on the F line is just a few steps away from the flat. Perfect to discover NYC!\n5238,10492094,2014-02-22,9919955,Ignacio,\"Ben is an excellent host! The place works perfectly for two people and its very cozy. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"We stayed at Ben's place for a week around Easter. The appartment is quite small, but it fitted our needs very well and we had a good time. It lays in a nice neighbourhood, not much noise and close to both a subway station and some delis. We didn't spend that much time in the appartment, we were mostly in the city, so we didn't have the chance to use the kitchen very much - there wouldn't be any problem with using the kitchen though; it contains both a stove and a quite big oven. There might be a problem with eating homemade food, because the appartment doesn't have a dining table, but it shouldn't be a problem in a city like NYC, where there's delicious and cheap food practically just around the corner. We only ate breakfast at the appartment, and we used, quite creatively, some stools as little individual tables. We didn't have any problems with hot water - there were always enough for us three girls.\n5238,12485337,2014-05-04,10011683,Pablo,\"Pasamos unas excelentes vacaciones en el departamento de Ben</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Ben was a great host! I had a travel/weather issue on arrival and he made every effort to accommodate my delay. Great location with easy access to subway.  The apartment was just as describe clean, safe and cozy.  It has all the comforts of home. Had a good stay, wish it was more pleasure than business.  I'll will look Ben up again on my next trip to the city.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was an excellent room in neighborhood that was very convenient to everything. Very accessible by subway. Ben was very accommodating and made us feel really welcome. We had a really nice stay. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>This was a great little apartment and Ben was an excellent host. He waited for us upon arrival (even though we were late), and went through everything we needed to know clearly. He also made an effort to check up on us, which was greatly appreciated. The apartment is small but cozy and definitely has everything one would need for a stay in NYC. It is literally 30 seconds from the F train subway station, which is EXTREMELY convenient after long days out and about! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a very good stay in the apartment for our 4 days in NYC. The apartment is located close to the subway so we had an easy time getting anywhere. Although Ben was out of town, he was very organized and had a friend meet us. All went very well. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had an very nice stay in Ben's cozy apt on the Lower East Side. The place was comfy and as described. It stayed warm at night, despite the polar vortex blowing -16*C outside! Ben was very helpful and courteous, and remained contactable and responsive throughout our stay. Really interesting area, got a good feel for NYC staying here. Great cafe around the corner too.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Tout eétait conforme à ce qui était prévu\n5238,72959505,2016-05-05,25136645,Claire,Bien que Ben ne soit pas disponible pour des raisons professionnelles tout a été parfaitement organisé à mon arrivée ainsi qu'à mon départ. L'appartement est idéalement situé (100m du métro menant directement à Rockfeller Center). Celui-ci est bien équipé. Je recommande vivement ce logement\n5238,73509619,2016-05-08,25805845,Kazia,I stayed for three nights with my son and husband and Ben's place was perfect for our needs. He was very kind and accommodating and responsive to my many questions about restaurants and the area in general. He has amazing suggestions so take note! The area is interesting and rich with history. The apartment was clean and cozy. It is easily accessible to anywhere you want to go. Next time we are in NYC we will stay at Ben's.\n5238,76113074,2016-05-24,28886781,Andrea,Me and My partner had an amazing time in the flat.

You're less than a block from the F train stop and can easily get around all of Manhattan! Great location</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a good stay at Ben's appartment. Everything was like in the descriptions. Very close to the subway. Ben organized everything well so we could find his appartment and the keys very easily. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great locations for public transit, The F train is few steps away, The 6 train is a nice walk thru China Town, the D train is on Delancy about a 5-minute walk and you are close to the highway if you cab frequently. The Spanish restaurant next door food is amazing, as well as amazing Mexican Vegan restaurant up canal street. Laundry Mat and a pharmacy is next door as well, everything you need is within walking distance.  Perfect for a couple, its cozy apt with a very small kitchen area so if you cook it can be challenging. If you want to live like a New Yorker and walk to Manhattan Bridge for photos or perhaps walk across Brooklyn Bridge or even walk to East Village or Soho this is a great location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We stayed at Ben's flat for 5 days. His place is situated in a great location right next to the subway, which is helpful. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. Good communication. A good size flat for a couple. A few drawbacks worth mentioning when paying around £800 for the stay: a) pictures are somewhat missleading-the flat is VERY dark, almost no natural light so not suitable for staying in during the day, b) shower does not drain properly (which seems to be quite a frequent problem judging by the reviews) and toilet kept on blocking (Ben was responsive to this though), c) no cable TV though it is advertised and the Netflix subscription ran out on the second day of our stay so had to swich to our own - not a big deal but probably shouldn't happen when paying quite a lot of money for the stay. Overall, it was an okay stay (we only really slept in the flat and the flat was clean) but next time we would book something cheaper in Brooklyn as it is only one stop away from this apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My husband, 2 kids and I came into town for Chinese New Year to see my extended family. The location of this place is amazing - right in the middle of China Town, East Broadway subway station is right downstairs, playground across the street, cafes and restaurants all within walking distance. The place is small but we had enough room for even the 4 of us! Ben was a great host - attentive and flexible. Definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in this area.. and we'll look to book this place again when we come back in future years!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location, next to the subway station, Ben was very helpful and gave good advice for restaurants...</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ben's place is amazing. Great base to explore NYC. Very convenient to everything and a lovely part of New York.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Ben was extremely welcoming and helpful throughout the trip. His apartment was perfect for my two friends and I. It’s was super cozy and we were able to do everything we needed to do. We would make breakfast there and get ready and head out for the rest of the day. The location was great. We walked to the Brooklyn bridge and hung around China town. It was an amazing experience staying there.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Bens place is amazing. The location is perfect. Right next to the subway to take to uptown, we even walked a few times. Great apartment, great hospitality. Ben gave us plenty of tips upon checking in and also throughout our stay as well. Would definitely stay at Bens place again.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"L appartement est très bien situé, le métro est à  1 min à pied. Trés calme aussi, aucun bruit la chambre ne donne pas sur la rue. Nous y avons passé un trés bon séjour. Ben est très accueillant et arrangeant et nous a beaucoup aidé notamment   pour récupérer notre bagage perdu.\n5238,466621095,2019-06-09,104511510,Larissa,\"Ben's place was great.

She can be a great help with getting around NYC and what are the good restaurants, nightlife, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Kate was the best host we could wish for, she's been living in new york for a long time so she has lots of recommendations. The breakfast was spectacular, we could skip straight to dinner. She's such an interesting person to talk to we didn't want to leave the house. Also the location was excellent,best of both worlds, Hell's Kitchen with inexpensive ethnic restaurants and dive bars and buzzing Times Square at equal distance.\n5441,1547,2009-04-17,9805,Ana,\"Kate is a friendly</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>The reviews are a vivid testimony of Kate's hospitality, thoughtful and friendly nature no doubt! Even though I stayed a short period of time, she managed to make me feel at home and also made some excellent suggestions that otherwise I would've not considered. The apartment provides a warm & cozy vibe and the layout is great and the bedroom and bathroom very clean. The location is the best for it is walking distance to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, etc., and as a female traveling alone the area felt safe to walk at night. If you are looking for a place to stay, search no more, stay at Kate's! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This was our first experience with airbnb and it was definitely great. Although Kate could not be there when we were in NY (as she had informed us in advance), communication with her was really good and quick. She organized that a friend of hers was there to welcome us and also stayed at the appartment during our stay, which was great, as we got lots of information. We had some nice and interesting chats, too. Regarding the appartment: it is very clean and has a great location - close to lots of restaurants, Times Square, Central Park, public transport etc. We would definitely recommend staying at Kate's place and would stay there again, when we get the chance to visit New York again. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Great place and fantastic location, access to everything.  You couldn't stay in a more convenient location.  There are lots of stairs to climb but that didn't bother me.  Kate is the hostess with the mostess - she's a very kind  person and genuinely cares how her guests are doing.  I stayed there on my own for a few nights and the couple of nights Kate stayed too we had a great laugh.  Native New Yorkers always know the best places to go!  This was my first air bnb experience and it was an excellent one.  Would highly recommend Kate's place and will definitely stay there again.  I consider Kate a friend.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kate is an amazing host. She really goes the extra mile to make you feel welcome. Kate is lots of fun to visit with and has vast knowledge of the city which she is always eager to share. Without her advice we would have missed out on alot of great experiences.

Any time we are in NYC we will definitely stay here. </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Kate is friendly, laid back and very accomodating.  I was there for a conference in Times Square.

Very engaging and helpful with good advice on what to do and see.  She was extremely hospitable and sweet.  Can't beat the location: just a few minutes from Times Square and some GREAT restaurants close by.

The place was beautifully located in the heart of midtown and Times Square and so peaceful at night. She was very welcoming and made me feel safe in a new city. She even helped bring my heavy luggage up. We had great talks at night and she recommended great places to visit during the day. My room was very private, clean and nice. Kate stayed on her side of the apartment and didn't bother me at all. Would stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Perfect experience! Staying at Kates place was a pleasure. Easy and uncomplicated come together! Kate gave us good tips and information around our stay in NYC. Very centralized location. Thank you Kate!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kate was an amazing host :) she gave us great directions to get to places that we needed to go to. She is very welcoming and nice. Her place was a great place to stay at because it is very very close to Time Square. It is also close to the subways and it was easy to get there from La Guardia Airport.

As always</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Excellent central location in Manhattan near many attractions. Kate was a good host and gave me a lot of information that helped me during my stay. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Kate was not home during my visit but she was very good about arranging for me to get the key and making sure I got in okay. In general, she was a very responsive host. The apartment was exactly as pictured, clean and cozy. The five flights of stairs makes this a challenging location for anyone with large or heavy luggage. I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to Manhattan, especially people who want to sample the restaurants of Hell's Kitchen. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It's really good place! The apartment is really clear and comfortable. It's only 5 to 7 minutes to walk to the Time Square. Kate is a really nice person. We had some great conversation together.

Thanks again Kate!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay at Kate's place was great because the location was really good, it was a good value and check-in and check-out were seamless. Kate was nice enough to give us directions to and from the airport, and we were able to check in right when we arrived in the city and leave our bags at Kate's after check-out so we didn't have to carry them around the city before our flight! It got 4/5 stars because my husband and I thought the bed was pretty hard and it made sleeping comfortably a challenge. Overall, I would definitely recommend Kate's place if you're looking for simplicity and a great location.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a great stay at Kate's place. Really good location (2-3 minutes to Times Square and Broadway by walking) and near to subway. Kate is really nice, cool and kind. She has been attentive to all our needs.

If it was not for Kate, this trip would have not been nearly as amazing as it was. Great location, great host, best airbnb experience for me yet!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Kate is a person with a lot of knowledge about the city. She is very hospitable and very generous. She provided us with a simple and yet delicious breakfast. Her place is very accessible to the most attractions in New York. Almost everything is walkable. Her place is safe and secure. Her place is also near restaurants, shopping mall, supermarkets, etc. You can find anything that you need. If you are looking for a budget place, her place is the answer to your need. But it is only good for 2 people. My only comment is that, what appears in the photos are not exactly accurate.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying with Kate was wonderful! Even before we checked in to her home she made us feel safe by answering all emails and questions, she was very helpful all the way! Kate's home is very close to Times Square, so basically it is in walking distance of lot's of great locations in midtown, like Broadway, Hell's Kitchen, Central Park, 5 Th Avenue, Empire State Building, Bryant Park, and several subway stations. It was a perfect place to stay if you want to see and get to know New York on your feet! Taking the Subway either north or south was super easy too. Lots of places to dine in the surrounding area. Kate is a very welcoming soul, she opend up her home for us to feel comfortable. We had great conversations with Kate, she is a smart woman with lots of knowledge, and she is funny too! Every morning we had a good and simple breakfast, it was so nice to eat before we went out on our daily New York journies. Her place is excactly like described on Airbnb.

We would definitely go back and stay with Kate another time, she made us feel safe, and that was important to us. Thank you Kate!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>For the first time staying in an airbnb, Kate made this process smooth and pain free! With giving help with transportation to making sure we knew all the good places to go, she was an excellent host! Only downfall would be the five flights of stairs but that just gave us time to work off all the food we ate! Overall excellent experience and excellent location!

We will go back for sure to Kate's place!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kate’s home is amazing—cozy and clean, and in the heart of Times Square. It was only minutes from theaters and restaurants, in a safe neighborhood. Kate goes above and beyond all expectations, from first contact, and provided transit directions from the airport. I truly enjoyed my stay and getting to know Kate. She was extremely courteous and helpful, providing great suggestions for things to do and see. This was my first Airbnb experience so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but Kate definitely sets the bar high! If her place is available, don’t hesitate to book it. It’s great for people like me who wanted to see shows without being far. It’s very close to the subway, too. Thanks for your great hospitality, Kate!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Kate was an amazing host! Perfect location if you want to explore New York as a tourist as Times Square is right outside her doorstep. We mainly stayed there to just sleep and explore New York during the day and evening and Kate even gave the best tips for food (ask her about the buttermilk chicken). But she also gave us an insight and a peek into the past of how New York City came to be which adds another dimension of experience when exploring the city.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Kate's place is located in the centre of it all, but what's more, is that it is warm with sincere hospitality and fully equipped with everything you might need during your stay in NYC. We would definitely book her place again if given the opportunity. Kate was very knowledgeable about everything including where to eat, where to catch the train, and where to catch some great sights. It was an excellent experience for my husband and I.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Kate is a very friendly and interesting person to talk to!

The rooms and beds are cozy, clean and confortable as is the bathroom. Batman and Robin are the sweetest kitties. We love them. I would recommend Laurie's bandb again and again.

Clearly posted instructions available for things like tricky doors, cats, coffee machine & so forth -- all intended to help you be the good guest she deserves.  I'll be back!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Our stay at Laurie's is probably the best experience one could ever imagine through Airbnb.  Laurie is an amazing host, a knowledgeable tour guide of New York, and a museum curator all in one.  Her home is in a great part of the city, yet on a side street where I never had a problem parking just a few feet from her front door.  Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!  The house management team, Batman and Robin (Laurie's two cats), were friendly and ever-present.  I couldn't think of a nicer place to stay.  </td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Our stay was excellent! The house is great and Laurie very welcoming!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>We've just returned from another stay with Laurie in Park Slope. This was our third visit in all but the first since 2009 and it felt like returning home! Laurie's place is the perfect retreat in the big city - quiet, comfortable and homey, we'd never consider staying anywhere else.  As always Laurie was the perfect host - armed with a wealth of information on restaurants, museums and other activities to keep us busy. In fact, more like a friend that a host, conversation was always interesting and fun. The bagels and croissants provided each morning were the perfect start to the day, not to mention the excellent coffee. It was also great to see the adorable resident cats - Batman and Robin - once again. The neighbourhood has changed a little since our last visit but only in a positive way - there are now even more fantastic restaurants and bars to try out and many are right on the doorstep. Park Slope really is the perfect base to sample all of what Brooklyn has to offer and apparently there is a small island called Manhattan not too far away if you run out of things to do! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Laurie's home is the perfect way to begin your trip to the city. It is beautiful and exactly as photographed. The garden is amazing and the proximity to the subway makes it an awesome choice. Laurie is a supremely gracious host, with fantastic advice.

I can not wait for my next big apple adventure and would stay here with out question.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"We had a really nice time in Brooklyn. Laurie Kellogg is a magnificent host.

It's a house with a history... lots of books, pictures and drawings. A bit messy but really cosy. We felt at home immediately.

The rooms are a good size and it was great to have our own bathroom (which also has a washing machine and dryer which we used once).

Laurie was very helpful with any issues I had during my stay... problems with the taxi driver, maps for New York, restaurants etc. Also she took care of my laundry, what was really nice. What is important for guests to know is that there are other guests on the same floor, so you have to share the bathroom. Laurie has a helpful son and two nice cats, so don´t be afraid of Badman and Robin (the cats), because they might jump to your bed in the middle of the night..... :) Would recommend this place!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"We (me and my wife) had an amazing time at Laurie's place.

If you want to stay in the heart of Manhattan, in a clean, safe, and comfortable home, and at a nice affordable price, this is the answer. Do remember to pick up  earplugs for a good nights sleep.

The TV only had a Roku which was fine with us but there is no cable for those unfamiliar with Netflix/Hulu etc. Wi-Fi was available but spotty. The host was nice and responsive while messaging but quiet and a bit awkward in person. The biggest issue we had was with the front door. We were not warned that it was tricky, and only shown how to lock/unlock from the inside at first. When we left for the first time we tried practicing unlocking it from the outside and couldn’t do it. The host heard us struggling and came down to show us but it was still difficult for us to open when we got back later that night. I messaged for them to come help us and they did but they just seemed very inconvenienced by us. We apologized several times for needing more help and they didn’t say anything back or reassure us that it was ok. We looked at past reviews and it seemed like we were not the only ones to have this issue. Another issue we had was the noise, some of it was from the street and construction outside which we expected and didn’t care about but one morning we were awoken by someone screaming upstairs and loud bangs (the hosts live above the apartment). We probably will not stay here again due to our experiences but overall the apartment was very nice and conveniently located!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Somewhat mixed feelings  about this one.

For travelers who are looking for a higher end accommodation, this is the place for you. Jane’s home is located within an amazing neighborhood with fantastic restaurants and shops in walking distance. The subway can be picked up in several locations within a 10 minute walk. Not for everyone but we loved walking the neighborhood and integrating into the community. Right down the street is Fort Greene Park. A lovely park that houses a farmers market on Saturdays. I wouldn’t think twice about staying with Jane again.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Jane's apartment is spacious and very well decorated.

Thanks for everything Jane!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Jane advertises this spacious (slightly below-)street level apartment as 'Perfect for your parents', which might be true but it is more than that. It is even perfect for a father and son! We (father (56) and son (17), Dutch) spent a very comfortable time here, Jane was kind enough to set up both large beds in separate large rooms so we could both have a sound and well deserved sleep straight out of JFK (good connection via AirTrain and subway) and the following night. There is a charming park around the corner, with an interesting history, and you can find a fun farmers market there as well on saturday mornings. The building is a classic brownstone building, in a classic brownstone street, with a nice atmosphere and almost no traffic. I heard no sounds at all at night from the street, nor from Jane who lives above the apartment. She was very welcoming, explained the essential things clear and to-the-point, and is very happy to answer questions, although we didn't have any. Plus The apartment has the biggest tv-screen I've ever seen, with more channels than I could count. And garden doors that open to the spacious garden, but we kept them shut because it was November...;) TL;DR: great apartment, great neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Doti is an amazing host.

On our first day, one of us asked for orange juice and toasts.  As this was missing, Doti proposed to go right away to buy some for us.  Guess what... on the second morning, there was orange juice and toasts for us...  she even proposed us to cook eggs as she thought we had not eaten enough.  Doti is always doing her best to accomodate people and help us planned our day.  A few times, she searched the internet to help us better plan our day and to provide information on shows going on.

The location of her apartment was ideal and she was extremely helpful. I really enjoyed the stay , thank you Doti! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This was the perfect stay! My bf and I were in town for a wedding. We usually stay with friends, but they've moved out of the city. Fortunately we were able to book Doti's amazing place. Her apartment is in Chelsea, very convenient to everything. We walked mostly, but could have easily gotten on various subway lines. There are too many restaurants  and shops to name in walking distance. It was vibrant, but not loud, and we always felt safe. The bedroom is much bigger than we though, and Doti has thought of everything even robes and slippers! And she provided breakfast every morning and was kind enough to serve us on our schedule. I'm not sure my review will do the stay justice, but it was excellent!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Doti is a gracious host and has traveled a lot.

Look carefully at the pictures, because the hostess uses her space wisely and efficiently as all walls are utilized. The bedroom is huge. In fact, it is bigger than my hotel room at HGU.  The power strips on each side of the bed are accessible for all your electrical needs. Antique furniture is adorable and the mirrors on each side of bed are handy as the bathroom does not have a power outlet. The dining area is quaint, the kitchen compact. Coffee very good. Host and hostess are friendly and want to meet your breakfast preferences, but. Their specialty is local bagels with cream cheese and also bagel egg sandwiches. They have tips galore!  I needed a cobbler to fix my shoe, and was recommended  a close and reasonable one. Directions? I was pointed quickly in the right direction. By the way, the locations is ideal close to public transit and minutes away from everything. This apartment is shared with the hostess.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I enjoyed my stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The bedroom was large and very clean. Doti took great care in assuring that I had everything I needed, including a good breakfast in the morning!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Chelsea perfect is a good name for this listing.

The apartment is very spacious for a 1 bed and was perfect for my husband and I and our 11 month old baby. Adam and Charity kindly supplied us with a crib for the baby. The neighborhood is full of beautiful brownstones and Nostrand ave has a couple of small grocery stores just 5 minutes walk away. We didn’t explore the neighborhood much as we headed to the waterfront each day. It’s just a short ride on the subway to downtown Brooklyn and amazing views of Manhattan.

It was perfect for us who didn't want to stay in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan.

The bed is hella comfy, and the pillows make it feel like home. The space was everything we could have wished for and more... but what made our stay absolutely wonderful was Adam’s insane hospitality and care for his guests. He held our luggage in his own home because we had a conference to go to immediately when we got there and the previous guests hadn’t left yet. He didn’t charge any extra for this, he just went out of his way to help us out (as well as give us an incredible recommendation for a breakfast place nearby!) Next, the last night we were there we stupidly lost the set of keys at the restaurant we were at. We looked everywhere and literally couldn’t find them at all. We felt sooo awful for having to call him so late, but he kindly opened up the apartment for us, and gave us the extra set of keys. Absolutely outstanding hospitality. He didn’t have to do any of the kind things he did for us, yet we so incredibly appreciated that he did. Thank you Adam. We will definitely be back next time we’re in Brooklyn!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>A truly amazing find and a beautiful apartment.

The host is kind, considerate and generous. She is using her own house to do the Airbnb housing as a charitable fund-raising project for people in Haiti. In one word, if you want to have a wonderful stay and do some good deeds at the same time, just contact the host!!! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lisel is a pretty nice host and the location is super good. It's near two metro stations with all the lines you need to get to any places in Manhattan. The 5th ave nearby has so many good restaurants. You don't have a private bathroom. The shared bathrooms are clean but shampoos and body washes are almost running out. The sofa bed is more comfortable than i thought, which is good. The real bed is small and can only fit one person. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lisel is fantastic and went above and beyond to be an amazing host!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Lisel is an amazing person who has a global mindset!

The room was large and super comfortable. The outside temps may have been freezing, but we were cozy and warm in our peaceful surroundings. Lisel’s home is quiet, yet it is vibrant and full of life. Lisel goes out of her way to make sure her guests are familiarized with the ins and outs of the house, and that they feel comfortable accessing all there is to offer. She is very knowledgeable about the neighborhood as well as local  sites and transportation options. This home is run from the heart, and you feel the love when you are there.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lisel and Rita are lovely hosts, it was great to meet and listen to them. The room is clean and comfortable. Location is good to live the heart of Brooklyn and is very close to a staple like prospect park and to everything you need, like restaurants or shops; furthermore, it is a few minutes walk to the subway. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Lisel’s place is in a GREAT location. Can’t be beat. Her home has a very lived-in feel, and staying there reminded me of hostels I stayed in during various travels abroad. This place has everything you need, but isn’t luxurious or overly comfortable. I was grateful for the TV and air conditioning unit and got good use out of both. When I first arrived the lock on the bedroom door was broken and the door didn’t completely close, but it was fixed a few days later. Lisel seems very warm and checked in on me a few times.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This place is full of character a lot of art in the walls and a great supermarket just around the corner super convenient but the best part was interacting with all the other guests, all amazing people Lisels friends included! I would totally stay there again, in fact I probably will. Highly recommend it because it’s also super affordable.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Lisel’s place is wonderful! The house itself is superb: nice and cosy rooms, large bathrooms and large kitchen. Lisel herself makes your stay one you will not forget: a beautiful and great person who makes you feel so welcome at her place and invites you to events you likely would not known of otherwise. She is not only a great host but with a wonderful character, helping people for whom who’s desire it is to live in freedom and/or needs someone to take care of.\n8110,454618656,2019-05-18,257656311,Mike,Lisel's house is an excellent addition to any community and a delight to stay in.

She was available to give us advice and directions whenever we needed them.  Maison des Sirenes is beautiful.  It feels so much like home.  The apartment is decorated eclectically, and is very clean. The kitchen is well equipped.  Nathalie has also made restaurant and site seeing guides for her guests to use.  There are plenty of maps available too.  We used the bus map a lot! Williamsburg is not too far away, and has a neat vibe to it, with yummy food and fun shopping.  We ate at Bliss and stopped into a shop called Whisk, before we went to see a show at the BAM.  We also had an amazing dinner at an Italian restaurant only a few blocks away called Saraghina.  Nathalie recommended it to us, and we loved it!  I must be honest and share that I did have concerns about the neighborhood at first because my sister and I were the minority, which is a huge switch coming from white suburbia.  However, nobody bothered us, or even gave us a sideways glance.  I think our discomfort came from our own selves.  We ended up putting our concerns aside, and walked to dinner in the evening and had a great time.  I want to thank Nathalie for being so welcoming and hospitable.  We would love to come back!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Nathalie's place is just amazing. We felt in lovewith it as soon as we saw the pics here, but what you find when you get there is even better. Nathalie is super nice and helpful if you need her but even when she lives downstairs you won't even notice her unless you search for her. The apartment is decorated just as seen in pics, but there are beautiful details that you only see once there, such as candles, cd player with relaxing music, everything you may need in kitchen and bathroom and a beautiful terrace that we'll defnetely come back to enjoy in summertime!

We did not meet one person that was not friendly and welcoming. There are little stores and any kind of food you desire.  We took the subway to Manhattan (I definitely recommend the Carnegie Deli - split the order with someone!!)  It was so nice to come back to Maison Des Sirenes at the end of the day and relax.  The Italian Resturant in the next block is not to be missed (Website hidden by Airbnb) While this is not the normal \"\"bed and breakfast\"\" experience of having someone spoil you - I will recommend this place to everyone.

We felt warm and cozy on the rainy cold days we stayed there in December.  Our elderly mother was very comfortable and it meant so much to her to have a place where her family could gather.  The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed.  The light and layout of the apartment was excellent, and the backyard upper deck was beautiful and private feeling, like the rest of the apartment.  We would have enjoyed using it had the weather been better.  The pictures show the place very well, but the details of the two fireplace mantel pieces, the old plaster moldings, the wood work and chandeliers were wonderful to see. All in all, a great place for us to land for our family gathering in a perfect neighborhood.

An additional wardrobe would be nice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The rooms are very good, the facilities are very complete and the location is not far from the subway station.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment is in a great location on a quiet street. It is an older place that shows its age but comfortable. We were moving our daughter to Brooklyn, so the location was perfect for us. If you are going to be busy and just need a quiet, no frills place to rest your head, this is a good choice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nathalie’s place was a good fit for my boyfriend, myself, and best friend. The layout was such that we could each have a side of the studio style space, but still maintain some privacy. I would only recommend for close friends/family. Nathalie was also able to offer me a slightly later checkout time, which was appreciated. It took us about 35-48 minutes to get to the village/midtown on the metro. Overall, it was an easy location. It’s an older brownstone and it shows in many areas. For anyone who is hoping to sleep past 730a, this location might not be for you. There are no curtains in the main room, therefore the sun comes through quite early. The people upstairs have children, and their day starts around that time as well.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"it is a nice and lovely place with really good deal.\n9518,506364,2011-09-06,908779,Santosh,\"The reason I am reviewing is coz the comments shon made on Elise's review.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Loved my stay in Inwood.

It is not so close to the center of everything but there is very good transport and we got to see a different side of the city which had really nice people and cheap places to eat. Not for light sleepers luckly for us we liked the lively neighborhood and Latin music!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We spent 5 night by Sohn. Did not meet Shon, but Doris was a very friendy and helpfull host. The flat is really close to the Time Sqaure by metro. It is a good location. The room was also good and comfortable. New York is awesome. We loved it so much. I recommand this room to everybody.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td> Directions were good, but it went downhill from there. It is a 4th floor walkup with litter and an unclean smell in the hallways. The room did not look as pictured on the website and one end of the bed was held up with books. The bathroom was not that clean. If you are using the place just to sleep-forget it. The courtyard is a gathering place until 4:30a.m. and the sound carries well. Upstairs above the bedroom there was bouncing until 2:30a.m-probably kids or very energetic adults. When we read reviews, they were mostly positive. But if you read reviews of the other bedroom Shon-Shon rents out in the apartment, they are more realistic. The room and sleeping experience was so bad that even though we had paid for two nights, we only stayed one night.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"It was a wonderful two days short vacations at Shon's house.

We got our own key. So we had the chance to go out and come back whenever we wanted to. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The only pros about this room is that is affordable. It's a very clean room and spacious. However, if you are looking to rest at night and have a good sleep after enjoying  New York or rest after meetings this won't happen here. The amount of noise that happens in this building would hardly let you hear the TV or even yourself speak. The building is also very filthy(dirty) and the neighborhood as well. The family that lives here is nice (to an extent) and quite. However, my boyfriend had to deal with a very unpleasant way of checking out. He was asked to leave around 9am. Moreover, there is plenty of affordable private rooms and apartments at Airbnb at an affordable price just that you have to book with time. Luckily we found a great host who allowed us to book their place at a very short notice. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Host is amazing, and very helpful. Her neighbors will help you as well. At first I didn't think it was going to be safe, but our first night there I felt very safe! No problems At all and everyone was nice. Super clean and close to subway. Doris will help you with anything you need. The AC is amazing, and needed in NYC! This is our favorite out of the two places we have stayed in NYC. Highly roccomend it!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a great staying. The room and the bathroom were clean and comfortable. The people in the house were very nice and welcoming and we had a great time. The apartment is about 2 minutes to the subway which goes to Timesquere and to the center. I saw a review on the nighberhood and I have to admit that first we were shocked because we didn't used to this kind of people but they are very nice allways blessed us with good morning and smile :)) </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"I had a good stay at Shon's apartment but I would need to compliment Doris instead as Shon was not reachable and made my arrival not so impressive since the taxi couldn't find the address and I could reach out no one for help. No clear information on the direction provided and I felt that it would be more helpful for people who's not keen with NYC map if there was a description that the apartment is located on 4th floor and is required walking to the gate and then the building entrance. Other than the communication, everything else was fine. Shon's family was very welcoming me and kept my privacy as priority. The room is spacious and provider everything a traveler would need for. Doris even offered me a lock so that I can lock my room when I go outside and I took her offer for a piece of my mind. What impressed me the most was the day the heater broke and she was so kind to boil the water for me to shower. The location despite was quite distance from main attraction i.e. Times Square but it was never a problem since the station at St.207 is in a very close walking distance. What I also like in my everyday of staying at Shon's was to walk pass the empanadas shop and I couldn't resist to stop at the shop everyday, perhaps that was the best empanadas in my life. Thanks to Doris for her hospitality and thanks to Shon for accepting me to stay in your place. I hope my comment is constructive so that you could improve the whole experience for traveler and I'm hoping to return back one day. \n9518,123731074,2016-12-30,24089112,Gretshen,We have a great experience.

This airbnb was a great place to stay. There was always fresh coffee (which I regret not taking advantage of more). The bathroom is a little smaller than what I imagined but it wasn't bad. There I was a little loud in the evening from the neighbors outside but I had no problem sleeping through it. There is limited outlets in the bedroom but there was a power strip provided. If you have a lot of electronics to plug in at night I would plan accordingly. Overall, this was a secure place to leave our things while we were out enjoying the city and a good place to come back to at night to sleep. We were able to come and go as we pleased. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I really suggest this place to stay. We stayed 6 days. The family hosted us is so cute and really good.

We were less than 5 mins away walking distance from the train that would take you anywhere you want  to go. The local restaurants had pretty good food. Parking is incredibly hard to find but there is a parking garage nearby. $15 for 12 hours and $20 for 24 hours.

I am just gonna state the facts without any judgment. First of all, the picture in website is not the room we got. No drawer and headboard! Also we could not use the kitchen. we were only allowed to put our water bottles and fruits in the refrigerator. No equipment to make hot water at least for a coffee/tea!Also be advised there is no elevator in building, considering the house was on fourth floor. If you use a car, finding a parking spot in neighborhood is almost impossible. There are two parking lots around, however they charge on the weekend about 30$ for night (20$ for weekdays). If you use public transportation the location is close to train station which is a good point. The most annoying thing for us was loud music people played till 3 AM every night in the common area of complex. We couldn't sleep well and so every next morning woke up tired, without energy which you can imagine for a 3-4 days trip, how it can ruin the whole experience of visiting NYC. If you enjoy such thing you should be fine! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was a great experience but the place is kinda noisy sometimes specially during night. But overall it was all good and the location is accessible to the train station. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>My stay here was awesome; the location was near a lot of places I was visiting ( clubs and lounges ) and it was easy to get around. The host Doris was the sweetest and an amazing person, made my sister and I feel very comfortable; almost like family. I definitely recommend booking here. Whenever I do return to New York I won’t think twice about booking here, they were awesome!!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>A wonderful place, a really nice place, an amazing family trying to help all day and making better your stay... is not that close to downtown but it’s really easy to go everywhere!! We really enjoy been there!! Thanks a lot Doris!!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We had a really good time in NYC from the first day to the very last minute.

One of the best things about the place is Sally who will be your host, your friend and your guide to New York if its your first time visiting.  She's lived in New York for a long time and gives excellent advice about where to go.

We didn't meet Ssameer, but his roommate Sally was there to greet us. She is a really nice person and she really knows her way around town.

I am a person that is very organized and plans everything so I suppose it can sometimes be a really demanding person that asks l (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ts of question.

Don lives in the apartment and was not only extremely helpful but also quite personable, most interesting, and fun to get to know.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Our stay has been very amazing. One of the cheaper options to stay in New York City. The location is very convenient as a few steps from the unit would take you to restaurants, laundry shops, subway station, and a lot of things you need. One of the reasons for this wonderful experience we had was Donaldo, he made our stay really amazing. We got a lot of tips to roam around NYC. He was very hospitable. He made the place felt like home away from home. Truly unforgettable and something to cherish upon.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Donald is the name of the unofficial co-host who stays at the property.  Unfortunately, after a few days of enjoying the excellent location and decent property, Donald was verbally abusive, aggressive and threatening to myself and my partner one morning after arriving in drunk and intoxicated at 8am. Donald pointed his finger and yelled at us that we were too feminine - bearing in mind we are two gay men - and should f*** off back to Scotland. We were then told to f*** off several times more before we could escape. Shaken by the incident, we had no choice but to book new accommodation that day for our final two nights. After a week of waiting for a response from the official host, we have received a sincere apology from Ssameer, who is abroad. Unfortunately we haven't received a refund from Ssameer, nor any significant action from Airbnb, 8 days after lodging a complaint. Do not ruin your stay in an amazing city with the risk of experiencing what we did - look elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Our stay at the apartment was great and much of it is due to Don, the host while Trip is out of town. Don was in touch with us the whole time to help with the check in, offered tips on how to get around the city and was just overall attentive and kind. The room itself was clean and has just about enough space to keep your luggage and get a good night's sleep (the bed's really comfortable too). Location was great, one block away from the subway so we could go everywhere easily. Pretty safe too, we arrived past midnight on several days and had no issues. Supermarket and McDonald's around the block come in handy more than once. Overall a great experience, thank you Don!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"Staying with Teri was great. \n9704,24842700,2015-01-03,13340399,Artem,Me and my wife were traveling in the USA on Christmas and Teri is one of the greatest people we have ever met.

Her house could be a Better Homes and Garden showpiece, and yes, it even has a large garden in her back yard.  There is artwork and books everywhere.  In fact, the photos on Airbnb don't even do justice to the beauty of the place.  The rooms are large, immaculate, and the beds are comfortable.  The espresso maker in the kitchen and fresh croissants and OJ every morning was a treat, and much better than even Starbucks can deliver!

I arrived way too early from a red eye flight, and Laurie was very gracious to let me wait in her living room and get settled in as soon as the room was ready.  Staying in a home versus a hotel is just what I needed on my business trip, and the location is superb... close to transit, close to Prospect Park for much needed walks and quiet moments.

Plus I got the use of the kitchen so I saved money by cooking for one or two meals a day. There were markets close by and even 99 cent stores for the razors, tooth brush and gym lock I forgot to bring. Laurie lent me an umbrella when I needed it. She's very cool and mothering. I also love her adorable, friendly cats, Batman and Robin. The whole experience was very relaxed and comfortable with that homey and eclectic feeling. There's wonderful art all over the house from her family and friends and a two too narrow creaky staircases which led to my adorable room. I liked the bathroom as well which allowed me good lighting to prepare for my nights out. Laurie also helped me navigate the subways with instruction and maps and recommend her friendly and efficient car service. Nearby is the Brooklyn museum which had the most awesome John Paul Gaultier fashion show and of course there's Manhattan which is incredible for exploring only a subway ride away. I hope to stay there again!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Laurie's home is warm and welcoming and so is Laurie. We liked the relaxed atmosphere, and the delicious croissants and yoghurt / cereal for breakfast every day. The house is in an elegant tree lined street close to the subway, and the cafes, food stores and interesting shops on 5th and 7th avenues. We found good coffee just round the corner at Cafe Regular on 11th st. Loved  the margaritas at Rachel's taqueria, and the jazz duo at Oliviers ...both recommended by Laurie. The F train took us directly to Manhattan. It was ideal to start our time in NY in a more low key way in Park Slope.

Laurie is very helpful and made us feel at home. After busy days sightseeing, it was good to know we had somewhere comfortable and relaxing to go back to.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Cosy, comfortable and convenient. The place is small, but private and quiet (well, very little street noise but bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper because of the pipes). Close to both the L and the M so very easy to get in or out of midtown or downtown Manhattan, or hipster Williamsburg, etc. A very good find, and we're thankful to Silvia for hosting us!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Two months later and I'm still thinking about what an amazing time we had in Brooklyn.  Silvia’s apartment is located in an upcoming neighbourhood near 2 subway stops which go directly into the city.  Add to this the fact that there is one of the best restaurants in the city nearby (Roberta’s (Website hidden by Airbnb) and you have yourself a winner.  You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the hospitality.  We drove to NYC from Nova Scotia, and we were worried about street parking while we were there but once we arrived it was no problem finding a spot (right across the street from the apt.) and the neighbourhood was very safe.  Just be aware most spots have a 2 hour window twice a week when you have to move for street parking and you’ll be fine.  I’ve seen other comments about the noise in the neighbourhood but either we were too tired to notice or we’re more tolerant because it was never an issue for us.  If you’re looking to do NYC on a budget, Brooklyn is definitely the way to go. We would definitely stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice Stay and good people who do care about your accommodations! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 nights to visit NYC on vacation. We definitely enjoyed staying at Silvia's basement apartment in Brooklyn and would do it again! It was a good deal and Silvia was very nice and accommodating. Using the subway, it took us about 50 minutes to get to Times Square, 35 minutes to get to the financial district, 1 hour 40 minutes to get to LaGuardia airport (if you take a taxi, it costs about $34). The subway station is a few blocks from the apartment, about a 10 min walk. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy and unsafe at first, but after staying there a while (often coming back late), I've found it to be pretty safe and every night, a police car would drive around. The place is exactly as you see in pictures, water was always hot, and the heater was effective, WiFi was fast, but the only thing that was a bit of a surprise to me was that the bedroom is the only room that you can lock off as your own. The bathroom and kitchen sink area are technically left open, as you don't get a key for these places, but I assume no one is really supposed to come down while we are staying there. Also, you can definitely hear the people upstairs walking and the pipes make some noise, but it didn't bother us too much as neither of us are light sleepers and we were always dead tired when we came back from the city. All in all, had a great experience and strongly recommend staying at Silvia's, especially if you want to save money on hotels!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Checked in on Thursday, and Silvia stayed out of our hair the whole time we were there (excellent).  The apartment is not luxurious but it's nice enough, because we weren't in NYC to sit around all day. There was some noise that woke us up in the very early morning, but other than that our stay was very enjoyable.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>All in all a very good experience staying at Silvia's. Silvia and her husband were really friendly and helpful. They live in a nice area away from the touristy city center, close to restaurants and bars. Their  recommendations really helped us to explore the area. Everything worked fine as to communication, check-in etc. There was always someone around if we wanted to ask something, but they never disturbed us. As to the room, it was everything we expected, as shown in the pictures. I would recommend staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Silvia and Ty are very friendly, and their cute little basement apartment was a wonderful oasis at the end of long days (and nights) of exploring. We really loved the neighborhood, an excellent mix of fancy and funky, and the tips provided by the hosts really helped to make sense of them all. There is so much good food around that the efficiency-style kitchen was perfect--who cooks when they're visiting NYC anyway? Clean, comfortable, and private. We were there for a week and only saw others in the building one time. A perfect haven. We'll definitely be looking at their place next time we head to Brooklyn!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Clean and cozy! Silvia is a great host; she is available for questions and guidance while respecting your privacy. The apartment has the necessities for a pleasant stay in Brooklyn. It's in a good location with lots to do. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>amazing stay, and great neighborhood! i would pay more</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>My wife and I stayed for a week while we toured the city.  We had complete privacy in the nice and cool basement space.  The neighborhood offers a good variety of places restaurants and cafes to choose from.  The L train is not too far of a walk, so access to Manhattan is not too difficult.  Silvia's place also had wifi and a great shower.  The only thing I wish we had were a couple more pillows, other than that our stay at Silvia's was very nice.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>We enjoyed a lot our week at Silvia bassement.

I would totally recommend this place.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>It was easy to communicate with the hosts to arrange my check-in time.  The description of the apartment is accurate.  It is very basic, but comfortable.  The lighting was good, the bed was comfortable, there was plenty of hot water and towels, and the wifi worked well.  Kitchenette is very basic, not set up for serious cooking, but it was nice to have a fridge.  The weather was quite hot during my stay, but the fan in the bedroom cooled things off at night so that I had no trouble sleeping.  It was also very quiet.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Very good, quiet place to stay. Had all needed amenities (no microwave though) and some great restaurants nearby. Pretty close to the subway too, ~20-30 minutes to downtown Manhattan. Sylvia was very welcoming and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Silvia and her partner Ty were really nice, reactive and available. The accomodation corresponds to the description, it's pretty minimalist and is located in the basement and accessible via a pretty packed garage and laundry room. It has a separate bedroom, a private bathroom and a small kitchenette with mini fridge and coffee maker (keep in mind that there is no stove for cooking so you can't cook dinner or even have dinner in the basement - no windows and no proper table to enjoy a meal). The bedroom is just under their apartment so you hear the lovely kids jumping around in the morning :) The area is nice, very fancy restaurants and bars, I would recomment 983 Café, Forest Park, Sea Wolf, Momo Sushi Shack, Roberta's etc. Silvia and Ty will give you a very useful recap of the bars/cafes/restaurants nearby the basement, vith (Hidden by Airbnb) maps so you can see where they are located. Very very useful thank you! You are near the L line (Jefferson Street) and the M line (Central Av) so you have several options to reach Manhattant. Amazing street art in the area, great vibes in the Latin American barber shops where they dance while working, groceries stores available, definitely a good area. Enjoy!!!! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Thank you for a good experience. We were so close to our daughter and the subway. We would definitely stay here again. </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>We had an amazing time in Tyrome's place. We didn't have much direct contact with Tyrome, but when we did, he was super friendly and helpful. The apartment itself is fairly basic, but I think this is reflected in the price. There is so much to do in Bushwick (amazing restaurants, bars and events) that we just used the place for sleeping. Would definitely recommend!!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Tyrome was an excellent host - letting us drop off our bags at the apartment before the check-in time so that we could wander off, and letting us leave them again at the end, as our flight didn't leave until the evening. He was great with communication as well.\n11708,120314094,2016-12-09,28854603,Mirian,\"Todo estaba tal y como se describe en el anuncio. Buena comunicación de transporte. Tyrome nos dejo una carpeta con bastante información de la zona</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>You get what you pay for. There is noise from the heating and the apartment is in the basement, it is a fact. Tyrome was a very friendly host and we indeed had a good stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice short stay! Good area good food good people!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Great place! Cute apartment, perfect for place to stay to enjoy Brooklyn and Manhattan. If you are just looking for the basics, a bed and a bathroom, this is it. If we were staying longer and were looking to stay in and cook or anything, this is too small for that. But since we wanted to explore all day, this is all we needed, and the price is right. Tyrome was very kind and had an awesome art gallery that you walk through to get to the apartment. There were two locking doors so we felt safe. The neighborhood is amazing, right next to Alphaville which is a cool bar and venue. The walk to the Jefferson stop is a bit of a hike for those who arent used to walking like a new yorker, but overall it was close enough to everything. I would stay here again for sure!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The space is large for New York, the hosts are quite private and give you space, which was good.  The linen a pillows were lower end, but everything else was nice and we were happy with our stay.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Tyrome has been a nice host and helped us out wherever he could! The appartement was very basic, but functional. Definetly a good choice for a low budget, but maybe not suitable for people who expect a cozy and super comfortable place. We weren't a lot at home anyway, so for us it was perfect! :) thanks to Tyrome again! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"The apartment is overall decent, but was definitely not what we expected from the impression we got through pictures and description. The apartment had a changing odor from being the laundry room and the basement, meaning that it smelled part time of detergent and part time of moist. Furthermore we didn't have the opportunity to lock the basement door, which we didn't feel good about, due to all of our personal belongings being down there throughout the day. \n11708,177687841,2017-08-03,7086121,Ruben,\"El apartamento es mucho más bonito en fotos que en la realidad. Accedes por un garaje que está super descolocado. Es un sotano que huele mucho a humedad. No entra casi luz. Las dos únicas ventanas son minúsculas y se oye todo lo de la calle. La cama está humeda. El dueño vive en la casa (en la planta de arriba). Ni se despidió de nosotros. Un poco cutre todo y muy bizarro</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Tyrome's place is cool. It's a little different and quirky, but has everything you need. It's easily walkable to public transport, take-out and what looked to be pretty good nightlife. If we'd had a longer stay I'm sure we'd have checked it out!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Overall, for the price and location, this is a great stay if you aren't going to be spending much time in the AirBnb. We spent most of our time exploring the city and the host was very accommodating with check-in times and had the place ready early for me, which was much appreciated!\n11708,215109842,2017-11-27,145221646,Jordon,Decent spot.\n11708,215590791,2017-11-30,71097368,Jose,Don't necessarily rely on the pictures!\n11708,219101566,2017-12-16,63355817,Khristina,\"Ty’s place was amazing!!

Great use of a small space.  A fantastic grocery store is nearby as well as coffee shops, bars, art stores, etc.   This place is a good value!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Nice place, not the kind of place you will spend hours hanging out or relaxing in but has good basic amenities. Good value for a base in a good location in NY</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Private basement space with good cafes and restaurants around. Very easy to get to L train station to get to Manhattan</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Was a good overall and worth the price and good location. The door to the studio is iron so be careful of your fingers!!! Great if you just need a place to keep your stuff. Was very accommodating with checking in/out.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Tyrome’s basement apartment is in a good location with easy access to the subway. The apartment itself is good if you are just looking for a place to store your things while exploring NYC and a place to crash - not very cozy otherwise. It worked fine for our weekend in the city.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a nice stay. Tyrome was responsive and detailed with his messages. The flat itself is a good base if you are looking for something simple and no frills. Definitely not a place for spending a lot of time. Private bathroom was a big factor in choosing this over others in a similar price range. Location is also good – easy walking distance to either the L or M train – and close to loads of cool bars, restaurants, cafes. Its worth mentioning that noise from the flat upstairs can be loud at times, but not a big deal if you don't plan to spend a lot of time inside. Bed was also quite comfortable!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>This basement unit stays nice and cool for sleeping off your Brooklyn hangovers during a New York summer. Getting a private bathroom/bedroom in Bushwick is amazing, and entering through an art gallery will make you a cool kid. This place is small, so drop off your bags and go explore the vibrant neighborhood! You won't want to do much more than sleep down here.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great location! You have bodegas with coffee in the AM on every corner practically, and a good amount of local bars in the area too. A couple blocks from the train, would gladly stay again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Smooth check in/check out, the WiFi worked great and the apartment was close to many train stations and bus stops. The area had a lot of good restaurants.

I really enjoyed getting to meet him and discuss creating community around art. This spot isn’t a hotel room- but that is what makes it so great. It’s unique as it’s located in the basement of an artist gallery space and it’s minimal - but it has all you will need and it was nice and toasty warm. Yes- the heat is steam and makes noise but that’s what you’d expect in an older Brooklyn building. My partner and I loved the character of the spot and also it’s located in the middle of all that bushwick has to offer. Easy to walk to the subway and plenty of good food, coffee and bar options.

Edward was really nice and helpful host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edward was great. He worked with me to find a good check in time to accommodate both of our travel plans and was a really great guy to talk to, even though we never had the pleasure of meeting in person. He seems really nice. The apartment was in a fantastic location for the price - plenty to do nearby and easy to get to other parts of the city as well. The room is in a basement apartment = absolutely no natural light. It also seemed to be more humid inside the apartment than outside, which was surprising every single time I got back. However, there is a window ac unit in the kitchen that worked and successfully cooled the place down. The bathroom wasn't that clean, and you had to walk through the garbage courtyard thing to get to the front door. However, it was easy to look past all of this for the price/location. This room would be best for people who want a convenient, cheap location in Manhattan and only need a place to sleep and leave their belongings. Overall it was a fantastic choice for me. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"We stayed at Edward's place for five nights, he was a great host !

This small basement flat has a kitchen if you like to cook for yourself, there is space in two other bedrooms but we had the place to ourselves almost the whole time we were there. The key hand-off was great and Edward accommodated our early arrival with no difficulty. There is a lot to do in the immediate vicinity & awesome ramen 10 ft from the front door (Minca, yum!).

Friendly and helpful host. Clean, quiet to sleep. Very good wifi. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>What you see is what you get, small room in basement with no view but you stay here for the location and nothing else. Shared bathroom and kitchen were clean enough and Edward was a very nice and friendly host. Maybe the wall between the two rooms was a bit too thin. Anyway, I wanted a place in the middle of my favourite NYC area where I could sleep and keep my stuff and it's a good and affordable option for a weekend or a couple of days.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Edward is very kind and generous.   The place is so great and convenient to other famous locations.   For me, I love most of the things here.   However, you have to understand this is NYC.

Orestes’ home exudes a special warmness, also thanks to its interesting décor which comes from the mind of two very talented people. Orestes and Cristian are wonderful, friendly and warm hosts; they made us feel extremely welcome and at home from the moment we arrived. As for location, we couldn't have asked for a better one. The triplets are ideally located on a quiet historic street where we could rest peacefully after long days spent out & about, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are loads of nice restaurants (try LIC Market if you get the chance, great food & atmosphere!) and shops close by as well as a 24/7 diner; just minutes away from Manhattan by subway (with multiple train choices) and only a short walk away from the best view of the skyline you'll experience by far! The room itself is perfect in size, comfortable and very clean; it also has a sofa, TV, mini fridge, coffee maker and walk in wardrobe which, albeit small, is extremely handy! The bathroom has the best shower ever, amazing ...I still miss it & wish I could have taken it back with me ;) Last but not least, there is a lovely garden at the back where you can unwind, soak in the sun or have breakfast al fresco! We really couldn't have wished for better! Thank you Orestes and Cristian for opening your home to us and  for making our stay perfect.

I was expecting an intimate local experience with the benefit of getting an insider's take on my first visit to the fabulous city that is NY. Unfortunately, Orestes was away on holidays (which I only found out when I rang him a day before I arrived) the whole 5 days I was there. He said a good friend (who introduced herself as his neighbor) would be living there instead. The first day a non-English speaking house-cleaner was there to meet me to pass me the keys. Because I spent the first afternoon sightseeing I arrived to a quiet house at 10.30pm and spent the first night not knowing who was in the house. The next morning at the first sound of noises/footsteps in the house I went upstairs to wait to meet 'the neighbour' before she headed off to work. This was the only time I saw her in my stay but awoke every morning to the sounds of multiply people coming in and out of the only entrance which is through the bottom front door right next to do the guest bedroom.  I was never told who was going to be in the house and by the end of 5 days I counted at least 5 people, one other guy living in the same house (who never introduced himself), a dog walker and work colleagues of Orestes who made use of the 2 workstations in the same level as the bedroom for at least 2 of the days. One work collegue was working until 1 am one morning. Considering there is an opaque ceiling to floor window in the bathroom which is clearly visible from the working area I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower at night. Also my \"\"private\"\" bathroom was used by the work colleagues.

And if you'd prefer more privacy, that is also good. One of the best assets of this place is the location. Within a couple of stops you can get anywhere - from Manhattan to Brooklyn and Williamsburg.

We can park easily (we had a car). The only thing : be careful about parking because we had our car towed because it was parked just beside a fire hydrant we did not respect the 15 feet. But some neighbors helped us to find it. We never went to Brooklyn and it was just perfect. The \"\"petit plus\"\" as we say in French : the pictures which are in the wall of Adreinne's apartment are really beautiful and help to make you feel good ! \"</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Great proximity to the subway for exploring the city.

For any train fans out there, the bedroom windows look out on the Franklin Ave subway station and you can watch the S shuttle arrive and depart. Being so close to the train made it super easy to  travel around during our trip, and it's also close enough to walk to the G train stations. There's also plenty of great food and a big grocery store nearby, a good location overall! I'd definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>Alex's apartment is genial, interesting, eclectic--very much like him.  The location is supreme, on one of the loveliest streets--engrossing brownstones, lush trees, cafes/restaus/shops just a meander around the corner-- in Brooklyn.  Your privacy is assured in Alex's apartment but, should he be around, and you're keen to receive excellent conversation, or prosaic and poetic hints and leads about gems or happenings in the city, he's a wonderful resource.

Large</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Fort Greene remains just the best neighborhood to stay in in Brooklyn.  Alexander's apartment is on the main (parlor) floor of a 130 year old brownstone. The room you stay in is what was formerly the parlor (which means it's in the front and is large) when this was, in long ago times, a one family home. It has been converted to an 8 family, but Alexander's apartment is very good size, with a large kitchen and bath. The queen size bed and pillows were very comfortable and my frequently temperamental neck gave me no problems. The stay was totally smooth, although Alex was not there as he was away on business. Highly recommended! </td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Alex has been a wonderful host - very communicative and generous with tips and information.

When Alex returned we were room-mates for a while, and we had some good chats about common interests.  I'd highly recommend this as a place to stay.  One thing that some people might be sensitive to is that the heating is controlled centrally so the individual room control is limited to opening or closing the window; a minor point, and it didn't bother me, but if heating is a bug-bear for you... \n13394,26546105,2015-02-15,16595155,Sven,\"Had a great 2 week stay at Alexander's place.

The bed was very comfy and the room was clean and full of wonderful literature.   We very much enjoyed meeting Alexander and had time to get to know him a bit.  He's easy-going and flexible. We were attending a reunion at Brooklyn Tech HS, so the location was perfect for us and we found some small, lively, excellent restaurants within a very short walk.  A great experience overall.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Fort Greene park is one of my favorite places in Brooklyn, especially before 9am when it's off-lease time for a legion of four legged creatures. A very fun part of my morning commute for my week of work. The room is plenty large with nice tall ceilings and amazing morning light through 2 tall windows. The room is sparsely furnished but has lots of books and enough space to store a week's worth of clothes(hanging and in drawers). The door to the room is a sliding door which doesn't do much for audio privacy but works fine visually. Host was easy to plan with. This room is on my short list for my somewhat regular work trips to the area. </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Alexander is a very nice person. He did everything he could to make my wife and I have a good time at his house. He gave us tips of restaurants, free concerts and museums. We talked about our jobs, our cities... It was a pleasure to know him. The neighborhood is safe and calm. Brooklyn is an interesting place to explore and the Alex's house is located in a strategic area, not far to the Brooklyn Bridge and 3 blocks to the subway. It was a good exploring experience because although we know some of Brooklyn, it was the first time we stayed over there. Amazing.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Alexander communicates well and fast. The apartment is very much like being advertised. Very good location in Brooklyn, very nice to take every day citybike (just arround the corner) to manhattan over brooklyn bridge in less than 20 minutes. The place is clean and I guess a typical way many people live in new york which is a nice change to the normal smaller hotel rooms.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This is my second time staying with Alex. I love this place. Fantastic location for me. Old style charm. Fort Greene park is a magical park of Brooklyn. Alex is a wonderful host. Full of information and friendliness but also leaves you with plenty of private space. Nice green grocer and plenty of good restaurants a couple blocks away. A short walk to downtown Brooklyn where I was working for the week. A quiet residential street. A classic old yamaha keyboard for composing your next masterpiece.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>The apartment is located in a historic brownstone area of Brooklyn--very close to good eats, a beautiful park, and the subway.

Alex was very responsive and an engaging host.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>I had a really great stay at Alex's place. I was defending my dissertation so I was a bit on edge; he was invariably friendly and communicative when needed, and gave me space when needed. The room is large and very charming--perfect to have a place to work (desk at the far end of the room), spacious enough to do yoga. It was a very charming, relaxing home base to stay during a hectic trip. Also, Alex had good restaurant recommendations, all of which I either visited or tried out. The restaurant Walter's nearby is great for food and happy hour cocktails. In all, I'm very happy the trip went so well, and I recommend him as a host.</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Alex is an amazing host and everything was super clean!

We had a whole bathroom for us at the same floor, very colorful and relaxing. A couple of cons may be the wifi network in the room, not working amazingly and the bath tub not very comfy for showering but I definitely recommend this airbnb. The subway is very close, less than 5 min walking. The neighbourhood is not that charming but it's fine. Thank you for hosting us! </td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Had a great stay in New York in this characterful brownstone in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.  Very good instructions on getting to the house on arrival (arrived in the evening, NB actual entrance quite unobtrusive, with ivy over one side).

The hostess was a little bit slow to respond to our messages on the app, so the best way to communicate was through text message, but she is super friendly, warm and helpful.

Comfortable couch, 4 person dining room table, very simple but functional kitchen, decent sized bathroom with bathtub and good water pressure. She is a 4th floor walk up so keep that in mind & try to pack light. House is decorated with interesting, international & eclectic art - a bit cluttered but cute.

Large living room for Manhattan offered a cozy sectional in front of a TV, tiny kitchenette, and large table with 4 chairs for sitting. Back apartment was quiet. Large bedroom allowed room on BOTH sides of the bed - great for a couple! Also bedroom room for suitcase, space for getting dressed, and large mirror over the dresser.   But most of all LOCATION was amazing: 1 block to the subway downtown, a few steps to central park, and easy location for our Lyft Drivers to find us.   Close to all kinds of shops and restaurants. We recommend Lucciola on 621 Amsterdam Avenue, where we shared a delicious meal with our daughters of fresh pasta (including an innovative Cacio and Pepe, and delicious desserts - we shared three!) .

I would 100% stay there again if I came back to New York.</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>This apartment is very close to  central park.  That's the good part. The apartment itself needs a lot of work. The cabinets in the kitchen are all broken down and don't open. The sofa sends you into a hole. There is no cable TV. The air conditioning is in the living room making it hard to sleep when it's hot out. There is no where for you to put your clothes because all her stuff is in the closet and drawers. You can't see out the windows because they are so dirty. I was hoping there was a place for pictures here.

Roberta's pizza two blocks away is amazing, as well as Life cafe (two blocks away in the other direction).\n14290,103908,2010-09-24,31305,Are,\"My father and I were fortunate enough to stay at James Henrys loft in Bushwhick for almost 3 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>James was terrific and the apartment absolutely beautiful. The location is close to the train, the coffee at Cafe Orwell is as good as everyone says, and it's a wonderful, unique space. I recommend this place wholeheartedly!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>James is the a very welcoming artist. His broolyn loft is huge, comfy, the light is just amazing. This is a place to relax and have some ideas for a new project. I was there with 4 collegues friends for three weeks, I had the best time in Brooklyn ever. The area is great, Brushwick is the place to be in Brooklyn now for artists and all kind of easy going people. With the L-train, we are in the city in 15minutes. This is a fantastic place to stay. I wish I come back soon. xxx all the best to Jame's next guests, astrid serafini</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>I stayed in James' loft for 4 days in the beginning of November with a friend of mine and had an excellent stay. The place is even better than the photos - lots of light and space. It's very comfortable, clean and in a great part of Brooklyn. You can chose more hip spots like Cafe Orwell or walk down to Broadway & Flushing for great soul food and bargain hunting. We were two single girls and didn't have any issues walking home at night. The loft is under a flight path, but you don't hear the planes over head after a night. Other than that, it's relatively quiet. James is a great, welcoming host and has plenty of tips and is incredibly helpful.  Can't wait to stay here again during our next trip - thanks again!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>\"Fantastic location, James was an incredible host, thanks James!

We were delayed arriving in New York by about 20 hours but Jacquline went out of her way to give a friend of ours the keys, and then we lost a key and she was quick to help with that and very understanding. All-in-all an amazing stay. Would recommend to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Wonderful space! So zen! Huge for NYC! Incredible light, decor and the bed is really comfortable. Several coffee maker machines, and some great coffee left for us - so that was awesome. Plenty of tea, too. There is no tv and I could not figure out the projector but I had my laptop and internet was good. It is 4th floor steep walk up with no elevator but for NYC it is not uncommon:) Gave me some good cardio:)) There are some cute restaurants, shops and coffee shop nearby walking distance and there was plenty of free street parking when I was there (Fri-Sun). Hope to stay again, truly incredible space!</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>James loft was a great place to stay. It was very clean and very spacious .

Everything you might need is no more than two blocks away: great restaurants</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>Fantastic place in a really cool part of Brooklyn. I love Bushwick and it's industrial urban landscapes that have become more inhabited. I was a bit concerned about it being December and staying in a loft, but there was no need to worry, the place is heated amazingly. The area was exactly what we wanted, but just be aware that it can take up to an hour to travel into and away from Manhattan depending on where you'd like to go. All the communication is done through James' housekeeper Jacqueline who is super responsive and helpful. Next time I'm in NY I'll be checking to see if James' place is available!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>They did an excellent job converting a basement into a very comfortable apartment.  The bathroom tile and kitchen were amazing. The only negatives are the footsteps of their two kids running around early in the evening and the low ceiling support across half the apartment, hit my head a few times.  I also was quite surprised by the additional cleaning charge or $50. Personally I think that should have been a part of the rental charge, but oh well.</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"Just returned home from a weekend in New York City where I stayed in Jeanne's adorable apartment in Brooklyn.  We really enjoyed the Greenpoint neighborhood which is still not totally hippified and yet has plenty of excellent (and reasonably priced) restaurants to enjoy.  Getting into Manhattan takes a bit of effort, but is not a chore: the \"\"G\"\" train</td></tr><tr><td>amazing</td><td>A nice apartment- thoughtfully designed, and a pleasure to come home to after a long day out. It's true that there is a bit of noise from footsteps above, but not late at night, so we slept very well. The glass tiles in the kitchen and bathroom are amazing and the place was immaculate.

The place is perfectly renovated and decorated with excellent taste and timeless style.  The kitchen and bathroom were perfectly stocked with everything you could possibly need.

Jeanne is stunningly easy to work with, crystal clear about everything, and gracious to boot. The apartment is immaculate and quiet. Heaven for anyone looking for a place that both soothes the nerves and feels homey. Be sure to try the East River Ferry service at India St., as it is a great alternative to the subway. Also, be sure to try Anella's or the recently opened Gwynnet Street. Fantastic food. And the nearby Ashbox Cafe is a great place for breakfast (cash only).</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>Staying at t Jeanne's apartment made a great trip perfect!  The apartment had everything our family of four needed and was wonderfully finished.  We loved the Greenpoint neighborhood with its array of eateries, Champion Coffee, markets, playgrounds, etc.  It is also super convienient to get anywhere in the city due to its proximity to the subway and East River Ferry.  One of our favorite parts of our time there was talking with Jeanne and getting an insider's view of living in the area.  We can't say enough good things and are looking forward to our next visit!</td></tr><tr><td>excellent</td><td>\"With my wife Anna spent 15 days in NY pleasant.

I also felt very safe in the neighborhood. The apartment is also very nice to relax in and play board games, read, or make coffee - things you don't always have a lot of room for in a hotel. It feels much more like a home away from home than a hotel would. We were even able to iron clothes and hang them up. I loved walking to a bagel shop in the morning and picking up some bagels and then having a refrigerator in which to store them. Thanks for a great stay in Brooklyn!</td></tr><tr><td>good</td><td>\"In May we stopped for two days and two nights to see the city. My husband, I and my sister. Our host Jeanne's apartment was clean, decorated with tastefully. Everything was provided that was necessary for travelers.

One thing to consider is the soundproofing between the upper and lower level. We are sensitive to noise in the morning, so unfortunately when the family awoke up at 6 am we heard every step. Otherwise, it was good.\n14314,156837348,2017-06-01,3274071,Jeanne,My parents and my sister stayed at Jeanne's place when visiting me in NY.

Highly recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The basement apartment was pretty much as expected. Was clean and everything was as described. Good bed and my wife and I slept well. Better than most motel beds. Some noise from upstairs but not bad. A little warm when we returned in the evenings but cooled off with the fan on.

The private entrance is accessed first into the foyer then through the garage, then down the stairs past the washer and we had no problems with coming in late nights. Partway through our stay some other people came to staying in the other unit she has upstairs and you could definitely hear them but nothing too bad. Shower is small, but again, everything was clean and functional (hot water, wifi, heater, etc.). Great to have the mini-fridge and there was also a toaster oven, electric kettle, coffee maker, etc. and we were able to do a quick load of laundry partway through the stay which was nice (I never heard anyone else doing laundry, but the machine is loud). There is a lock on the bedroom door but not to the main kitchen/bathroom area, though, again, we never saw anyone in the garage or laundry area and I don't expect anyone came into our area. Bed was fairly comfy - firm - and there are now nightstands on both sides of the bed. Lots of great stuff in the area and Silvia provides a binder and map of her favorite bars, restaurants and cultural activities in the area. Several different subway stations within easy walking distance. Would definitely stay again - if you're looking to stay in Brooklyn this is a great, affordable and convenient option.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Very unobtrusive host! You pass through storage area to get to apartment, but it's not too bad. Tyrome left tips about neightborhood in his little purple book, and andswered questions quickly! I read some people complaining about 10m walk to train station. This is NYC. Better be ready to do some walking whenever you get out. Otherwise take a taxi or bus right in front of the apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This Airbnb is truly a BASEMENT : there is no light, a bad smell, mold, dust everywhere (we had to crush two spiders) and more importantly there is no aeration, so towels won't dry after the shower and quickly the smell gets worse. Equipments in the kitchen are very limited, dirty, the plates are dusty. There were tasks on our sheets, the pillows smelled badly, no extra-sheets. We stayed for two nights and we were very dissatisfied with our stay, we recommend you to RUN AWAY from this Airbnb for minimum comfort, even though the price seems appealing. On a more positive note, the Airbnb is not far from the subway, you can easily reach Manhattan. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ben was great and his place is cozy and in a very cool part of town.

However, the wrong name had been given to the people at the shop so when I told them my name, they said there were no keys for me.

Dimitris apartment is exceptionally clean with just the right amount of space needed for us all.  Having 2 bathrooms made it very accessible for our group. Each of the four bedrooms was a perfect size.  We loved the lounge which overlooked the street.  The kitchen is stored with all the equipment needed for a cook in. The apartment is surrounded by beautiful brownhouses, a convenient/deli store next to the apartment which was very handy if we needed anything, a barbar next to the deli store where my sons visited and recommend, 5 minutes up the road there are a line of stores, restaurants and bakeries for an early morning coffee and the subway just 10minutes walk away.  Dimitri is very organised with a folder containing maps, closest subways, menus, restaurants etc... Any other questions you may have, Dimitri is always available to answer.

Nichelle was a great host and, even though she contracted a bad virus during our stay, she did the best she could to help us. For example, she gave us money to get breakfast, because she felt that breakfast was included in the stay. We very much appreciated that, even though we felt that breakfast was only an extra.

When we arrived (group of 4), check-in was super easy and quick. Replies from Shelly were very prompt and helpful; It was not difficult to reach her at all. We stayed on the 2nd floor of the house. Shelly was a great host! Unfortunately, we did have some small issues while staying here. The wifi provided was very very slow. The free transit wifi at the train stations were much faster in comparison. Upstairs tenants were very loud at some points late in the night. We could hear stomping across the ceiling as well as stomping down the stairs right outside our door. It was NOT often we heard these noises; but when we did, it was normally around 12AM-2AM. We were not supposed to use the jetted tub that was on the listing description because of water leakage issues with the tenants downstairs. Another thing that we weren't very happy about during our stay was Shelly's late notice with letting us know that she was going to show the place off to some possible future tenants. We had already been out of the house for a couple hours before we received a message from Shelly (6PM) telling us that she was bringing people into the place we were staying in the next hour (7PM). Though it was rescheduled, some of us were not okay with the short notice given that all our belongings and valuable items were laying around the studio. If we were given up a day or so to put our laptops and stuff away, it wouldn't have been an issue at all. But, like I said it was rescheduled and nothing happened; it was just the mere action of it all. The house was located in an nice neighbourhood. There were plenty of convenient stores around the area and cafés. There are 2 different train stations that are super close by and are a very quick walk to both.

There are many excellent restaurants within walking distance and an easy walk to subway stations. It is a safe and lovely neighborhood and we felt comfortable at night as well.  It was clean and so much better than a hotel room in the city.  We were able to meet Annette briefly when we returned from dinner and she was leaving in a car.  She was very cordial and offered to buy us a cup of coffee at a bakery the next day where she worked.  This was our only contact with her other than the information she sent on how to get into the apt via a lockbox on the front step which was simple.   We did, however, have a couple of concerns during our stay.  There were 3 times when we arrived at the apartment and the front door was ajar to the foyer.  This was a little unnerving- especially when it was at night.  In addition, I contacted Annette by personal text and also messaged her via AIRBNB, about whether we could keep our luggage on the bottom floor in the foyer on the day of our future departure and that  we also had run out of toilet paper after two days and could find no other rolls in the apt.   I heard nothing so wrote again the next day - still no response.  I would have been completely fine if she'd said no on the luggage and that I needed to buy my own tissue  - I just needed an answer so I could make a plan.  I decided to call her cell the following day and the voice mail box was full.   I could handle all this--minor bumps for the most part-- but my concern was if there had been a true emergency, this could have been far worse.   I received a pre-programmed message telling me the details of the checkout on the eve of my departure but never heard a peep from her on anything else.  I texted Annette several days later after my departure and asked her if there was something we had done or if there had been an emergency on her end to make her inaccessible.  She did explain that she had a personal issue and was out of the time zone.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Area is actually good. All is like in pictures.

To begin to list all of the thoughtful touches and extra amenities would mean I would have to go on for paragraphs and paragraphs. I would like to mention, though, the thoughtful selection of cooking equipment and pantry essentials in the kitchen; the luxurious toiletries in the bathroom; the exceptionally comfortable bad; and the peace and quiet that only comes from living at the back of a Brooklyn row house. This was our first Airbnb experience as guests, and we are now spoiled for anything else. We wish we had had many more nights at Dani's fabulous place, and plan to come back soon for an actual vacation, rather than a semi-business trip.

Our first experience in E Harlem was so bad that I thought we would never use airbnb again. Evelyn changed our minds completely. I knew our visit with her would be good just based on all the positive reviews I read about her and the attention to detail she displayed in her listing. Evelyn was there to greet us personally when we arrived and my daughters and I immediately felt like we were staying with a great friend or family member. Our area was tastefully decorated and the bed in the bedroom was awesome. Evelyn even provided espresso and some food items for breakfast which no other host did in the other places we stayed. She had a vacancy for one night and allowed my daughters to sleep up in that apartment because it had a larger bed for them. The backyard was beautiful but we stayed so busy during our stay that we had no extra time to enjoy it. The neighborhood was very nice and we felt completely safe walking even late at night. Evelyn takes her airbnb business seriously and provided us with an experience in her home that made us want to come back and visit her the next time we come to NYC. I only wish that we would have stayed with her the whole time we were in NY. We definitely feel like we left a friend in Brooklyn.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>What's not to love about Eveland? The living space was huge and well furnished (the photos don't actually do it justice), the location was was great (lots of bars and restaurants close by, F and G trains within a few blocks for everything else), and Evelyn went above and beyond to make her guests comfortable and point us toward interesting things to check out. Whether it's your first time in NY or just your latest visit, you won't go wrong staying at Evelyn's.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great apartment! It's very well-equipped and secure. The front and inside of the apartment is beautiful! My only complaint is that it's a little bit of a walk to the B & D trains, but it's not a bad spot in Harlem and if you come to NYC and don't expect to walk a little, you've come to the wrong place!

He returned my call about 30 minutes later once I had already figured it out. When I first walked up the stairs and opened the room door the cat jumped on the bed and dug its claws in when my cousin tried to remove it. Other than the key getting stuck and the cat being on the bed my stay was not bad. The place is fairly clean and really quiet. However, both mornings as I got up to leave the host was sleeping on the couch downstairs which I found a little weird and made me somewhat uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend booking this place alone, it just seemed somewhat creepy to me, but booking as a couple would not be bad for a quick stay in Brooklyn.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"We spent a week in the apartment of Khem, as the first Airbnb experience: amazing, if the following are half as good, we will be satisfied, because Khem has been a great host, and from the first moment you meet as does at home.

Very clean great hosts and the neighbour hood isn't to bad either. Its on a great subway line</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This experience was like out of the twilight zone. Seriously. I've always had great experiences with Airbnb, but this by far was the worst. Let's start with the house being very outdated. Definitely needs some remodeling. I stayed in the flat on the third floor. So you basically have to walk up two flights of stairs (stairs by the way that are very loud and don't feel safe). Walking into the house there's a really bad odor of probably a mix of cat urine and mildew. It was very cold and the only way to adjust the heater is from the first floor. Which to me was a huge inconvenience. I also wasn't fully aware that khem would be living directly underneath me on the second floor. Another aspect that made me feel very uncomfortable. Not to mention, the doors to the second and first floor stayed open. On two occasions when leaving the house, I noticed the owner. Which made me feel like I was more so staying with someone, other than having my own place. The Wifi was horrible, tried to watch a movie on my laptop and it kept on going in and out. The shower head is very old and water comes out weird. It also takes a while for the hot water to come. I wasn't provided with enough towels and linen. Linen which but the way had a smell to them. I also had a situation when I went down to pick up food being delivered, I left the door to the place open and a cat that I guess lives in the brownstone walked into the place and just roamed around. After twenty minutes of trying to get it out, it finally left. That by far was the icing on the cake. I was never asked if I was allergic and cats honestly just creep me out. Khem honestly comes off as a really genuinely nice person. I'm sure his intentions are good. Two great take aways-the beds are very comfortable & its located in a very convenient area of Bed Stuy, Brooklyn. Overall though this home just needs revamping and Khem needs to be more detailed on all aspects of his home. I have certain expectations for Airbnb's and this home by far missed it's mark. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Sahr Ali is heel attent en duidelijk.

If you are not fond of large spiders hanging out in places that cannot be reached, this may not be the place for you. The bedroom, bathroom and neighborhood are lovely.

This listing is NOT as described or photographed. If you stay here, you are taking on a let that is NOT as described. Note: I have NEVER written a bad review on AirBNB, but AirBnB is kept safe by and relies upon truthful reviews in order to safeguard others from being exploited via listings which breech consumer rights as they stand under Trading Standards law. I travelled thousands of miles to stay here based on the photos and description: I was failed by both and in addition failed by AirBnB in not vetting this host and let thoroughly. I told the host and AirBnB that this place was dirty and not as described within 24 hours of arriving there. I took (and provided AirBnB with) over 20 photos of this let, evidencing dirt, rust, dilapidation, general dinginess, poor cleaning practices (I found nuts under the bed left by someone else) and poor workmanship. The bedsheets were creased and smelt of someone else. I was told by AirBnB to stay put and not to cancel the let otherwise I would be, essentially, homeless. Each of those three days involved washing at friends houses. I felt unclean after stepping out of the shower at this let. Three days after my arrival, I was still there awaiting clear direction and a phone call from AirBnB. On the third morning, after a phone call with AirBnB and being told to stay put that things were in process and that a case manager would call me, I left, taking refuge on a friend’s couch. The case manager has still not called. Yes, this place is old (and believe me I love vintage) but this place would need a re-haul to make it suitable as a professional and therefore AirBnB let: a repaint, new curtains, new kitchen light fittings and light shade, a new working fridge (rather than a failing one with an ice box clogged with a large lump of ice), wires need to be chased into near the kitchen, there need to be more sockets in the kitchen, rather than an extension lead right near a kettle with risk of water getting into electrics. There needs to be a new, clean shower cubicle. The place requires a deep clean by professional cleaners who know what it is to clean dirty places. The shower is grimy, the flooring composed of badly fitted tiles held by dirty grout at the edges. The let is advertised as having a kitchen: it isn’t. This is a small once-was bathroom space with a 1980’s microwave on its last legs and a toaster whose bottom falls out, the kitchen splash-back is rusty and dirty, the bin cracked and dirty, the table in the kitchen propped up straight by a wodge of dirty kitchen paper, the kitchen light fittings are dirty and grimy, there is evidence of rising damp in the kitchen ceiling – the ceiling paint is stained by damp, puffed and bubbled and protrudes.

The bed was comfortable and the room seemed to be clean. It had functioning air-con and WIFI. The room also has a small fridge, kettle and microwave which I didn't really use. What you can't see in the photos is that the bathroom has a shower which takes a while to warm up, but is fine.

I was freaking out because I can't swim and I wasn't used to motor boat rides, and because the ride was very bumpy (the waves were very choppy). But Paul sat me next to him and he was checking on me the whole time to make sure I was fine, slowing the boat when needed, and encouraging me constantly. He even had to cut the ride shorter to take me back to the shore, but offered the other guest to take him with him on the next ride to make up for it.

After about 20 minutes, Paul spotted a pod of southern right whales.  We slowly approached and observed them for 20 minutes.  Paul even put a hydrophone in the water so we could hear them communicating.  Paul was a great host and you will not be disappointed with this tour.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Very much recommend. There are never any guarantees, but Paul seemed expert at not only knowing where to go, but knowing what we might see there.

And the location is ideal - near great restaurants and coffee shops, and a very quick walk to several subway stops. The only downside for us was the smell of cigarette smoke--which seemed to get worse during the stay--so I imagine it came from a neighboring apartment.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is neat and clean and brightly colored. Everything was exactly as described.  The apartment is on the second floor so bringing our bags up was a small ordeal, but manageable. We drove, and there was a place on the street to stand while we unloaded. When leaving we actually got street parking around the corner, so that was helpful. The building is a typical NY apartment building. Sometimes it smelled smoky when we walked to the apartment and sometimes it smelled fine. Sheila can't control any of that though. In her apartment there was no bad smell, though you could still hear the neighbors doors slam occasionally. There are no blinds on the windows in the living room or kitchen, so be prepared to see the neighbors and for them to see you. There are blinds in the bedroom though. :).

About Ori and his contact in NYC, they were very helpful with the information in the emails and flexible with the checkout time, as we need to stay until 13.30. We had a really good time in NYC, impressive city and friendly citizens.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What a terrific find! To find this amount of room and space in such a terrific location was an unexpected delight. Having a kitchen with a refrigerator (no freezer to speak of) and a nice dining space allowed us to have a low key breakfast or lunch on site when we were short on time or didn't want to go out. The kitchen has all the basics that any visitor needs. It was also nice to have a flatscreen TV, wireless, and a radio. The space is tidy, but does have some personal effects, so it's not just an empty space. Happily, details such as hangers, iron, and hair dryer are provided. If you're sensitive to sound, do know that you'll hear some street noise, plus the charming character of the place includes very squeaky floors. Also, the 2.5 flights of stairs up, are steep, so if you've got heavy bags or bad knees, be warned! Ori and his friend, Lydia, who met us, were very friendly and responsive to every inquiry. Ori provides a great outline of the apartment and super helpful suggestions about restaurants and other resources. We would happily stay here again.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Ryan's place is wonderful! Conveniently located close to the town of Stowe, where there are loads of great food and activity options, and close to the Green Mountains where we hiked in the summer.

The pictures are spot-on. But beyond the technicalities of the house, what made the place great was Ryan's hospitality. He responded patiently and enthusiastically to my laundry list of questions (he had intimate local knowledge for what to do in the area that (Hidden by Airbnb) was less helpful with, like 'which hike/mt would be best to see July 4 fireworks from the summit?'). When a heat-wave hit Vermont he purchased an extra fan in preparation for our visit, even when he already prides his home as one of the few places with AC in the area. He had no idea what time we'd check in, but he went into the house early to set up the porch and firepit, and turned on all the lights/AC/fans to cool the house down. Can't go wrong with this home!

I enjoyed the air conditioner AND fan in the room.  There was cable and internet.  The half bath is right next to the room, and it was really clean.  The main bathroom is shared, but it is really clean.  This is important, because when I book hotels, the first pictures I (Email hidden by Airbnb) are the pictures of the bathroom that OTHER PEOPLE took.

She gives you plenty of privacy, and makes sure that you are comfortable.  I will definitely stay at Agnes's place again.  If I did not have so many other things to do while there, besides getting my hair done, I would have stayed in.  Also, I needed to leave my bags until around 6:30, and Agnes was okay with that.

Harlem!? Well, I don't know about anyone else but I have seen movies regarding Harlem in the 80s and once again my fears of a poor weekend showed up. Well those fears were instantly allayed upon arrival. The area appeared clean and the neighbors helpful. Wayne further put the fear to rest mentioning how the neighborhood has changed a fair amount from the days of the 80s, of course I had to see for myself so out I went. The first night there at around 7PM, I walked to Central Park (nine blocks away!) and wandered around for a while until about 9PM then it was time to start hitting up some lounges. First stop of the night was The Chocolate Lounge (3 blocks away (Website hidden by Airbnb) not a bad little hang out, stylish decor and friendly people, I managed to walk in right in the middle of a speed dating event and no one seemed to mind while even introducing me to some of the guests. Next stop of the night, around 11ish, I wandered on over to ALoft (also 3 or 4 blocks away (Website hidden by Airbnb) At the base of Aloft is a pretty nice little lounge (wxyz) where guests and neighbors alike gather to mingle. I stayed there until about 1ish when I decided to go hunt down some NY Pizza and ended up at Five Star Fried Chicken-Pizza - delicious! This took me to about 2:30 am or so when I decided it was time to hit the hay. The next morning I went for a run in Central Park (I have always wanted to do this) and spent the rest of the day exploring NYC. I ended up back in the area around 11pm or so where I hit up the Lenox Lounge (Website hidden by Airbnb) for some good ol Harlem Jazz where I stayed until 4am before deciding to head back to Wayne's. The third and final day, I spent some time over in Riverside Park (where I had to walk through the projects to get to) and then spent the rest of the day in Central Park before heading back to Wayne's to pick up my bags and head down to the M60 bus (four blocks away and a direct line to Laguardia! for $3!). Now, it would seem that I didn't talk about a lot of my trip during this review but the...</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>I'll start by saying that this is a great value and that the host, Wayne, was very friendly and welcoming. The location in Harlem is what it is, you get the experience of Harlem at the cost of being a bit far away from downtown Manhattan. This isn't a big deal since the subways can get you there so fast anyway. The room was exactly as shown in the photos and was clean.I t was really great to have a private bath (not available for all rooms in the building). Things that could be improved: Our room was never cleaned nor the bathroom towels replaced while we were there (5 days), but that may have been our fault. Due to some health issues and reduced energy we tended to sleep late and only left the room near noon most days. There was a coffee machine and refrigerator (a rare find for a B&B) in the room, but no coffee for the coffee machine. Also, if there had been a microwave in the room rather than having to trek downstairs to the shared kitchen we could have  made better use of the refrigerator. We never did figure out the TV channels- a channel guide would have helped, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway. This sounds picky-I just wanted to paint the whole picture. It really comes down to expectations and I've seen better for less money (but not in NYC) and worse for more money at other B&B's. Overall you get great value for your money  here and if you spend some time with Wayne you'll have some great conversation.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"My wife and I spent 9 days in the Private Luxury Suite and the experience was fantastic. What you see in the pictures is what you get, a very nice, quiet, clean, cozy and big room, with T.V, mini fridge, WI-FI, work desk and a private bathroom. We have our doubts at first in the location subject, but let me tell you, that Wayne's apartment is well located, yes, may be it is in Harlem, and because of that many people will think that are going to be far away from everything, but that's wrong! Subway is 4 blocks away, and it connects directly with midtown and lower Manhattan and all the highlights of the island like Central Park, Metropolitan Museum, Natural History Museum, Guggenheim Museum, Times Square, etc. In the 125th street of Harlem you will find several things that maybe will make your trip more comfortable like: Burger King, Mc Donalds, CVS, Marshalls, Old Navy, Children's Place, Carter´s, Ralph Lauren, Dunkin Donuts, Gap, etc.  All this just 4 blocks away from the apartment, isn't that great?!, there are other great places to visit in the nearby´s, like the Red Rooster Restaurant, Social Corner and the famous Apollo Theater that offers all kind of great shows.\n60666,17742024,2014-08-17,13092614,Charlotte,\"Nous avons passé une semaine chez Wayne du 9 au 16 août 2014</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wayne was de ideale host, zeer behulpzaam en vriendelijk.

We had just had movers come to move us out of our place down the block and we had planned on staying at Wayne's place to have a good shower and sleep on a bed after a long day of moving out. We had said when we booked that we would arrive around 4pm after the movers finish. When I called Wayne at 5pm he did not pick up (he was at work) but he did respond to email a bit later. He said he was working and would be home at 7pm and have the room ready at 7:30. My wife showed up at 7:30 and Wayne did not pick up the phone again. My wife texted while waiting outside and he responded to the text. From what Wayne shared he faced several breakdowns with someone staying in the place just before us and with his job (he said he works at the company dealing with a major water main break in NYC that same day and he had to change the locks after the last airbnb customer did not return the keys earlier that afternoon so he had to go to Home Depot before the room could be ready). Whatever the reason, the room was still not ready at 7:30. Instead of returning later that evening, since Wayne seemed frustrated and exhausted we chose to give him some space that night and we stayed at our empty apartment (no shower curtain, no bed, no towels, no bedding - we slept on the hardwood floors in our clothing and showered in our empty bathroom). I asked to talk to him the next day. He didn't respond to a number of text messages (it was after 9PM at this point). The next morning I texted asking again to speak on the phone. When called a few hours later and we spoke. He said that I had told him I was flexible and so he didn't understand my feeling that we had a terrible check in experience. I reminded him of my email from months before explaining our situation and that while I was flexible waiting until 8pm to shower and sit in a chair (or lie in a bed) after movers had moved us out of our place that afternoon was excessive. I explained that he seemed overwhelmed and that if he didn't want us staying there we could work out a partial or full refund. Amazingly, Wayne could not understand why we had any issue and he became frustrated on the phone, raising his voice to explain his circumstances and all he had done in the past day to make the room ready despite it all. Wayne said that we had a difference of opinion and that it didn't make sense to keep rehashing our different perspectives. I returned the keys to him and we stayed on our floor a second night before leaving for our vacation. We had hoped to resolve...</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Amabilidad insuperable, muy atento y todo muy limpio.

Being on the 2nd floor means the noise from the street is bad so bring ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall, I had high hopes for the stay. We were warmly welcomed and things were clean and ready upon arrival.  It was unfortunate that it deteriorated throughout the stay. We were without electric and AC in rooms for durations at a time.  We also weren't able to use the stove or oven for weeks at a time (we were there 5 weeks total).  When these issues were occurring, the host was unreachable or didn't respond several times at all. She did offer a refund for the food in the freezer that went bad, but I declined because the overall inconveniences of being unable to cook and without electric and AC for periods of a time did not equate to $50 of food to me.  I think that with improvements to the unit and having someone on call if she will be unavailable or unreachable would begin to improve the stay for others.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Overall, we had an outstanding experience with Laurine, and a good experience in the apartment.

There are not a lot of places to eat within close walking distance so plan ahead.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Honestly I had high hopes for this place. Once I rang the bell  to enter and the upstairs neighbor answered it went all bad. The house itself was nice but beyond that not so much. The host herself was not in town which was shocking. Also while I was at work I get a text from the host who was overseas. That there was a complaint of smoking in the house. I apologize for that and I told her that was my husband at the time but you did not know that it was a non-smoking house. Afterword we did not smoke inside the place there was other complaints and to the point where the upstairs neighbor stomped so hard on the floor to the point where the ceiling fan light broke. I went to tell her but, fortunately enough she was already calling me about the complaint. I explained to her that I was not or he was not smoking she was not concerned about my safety. She did not let me know she was going to contact the neighbor about their description. So I had to handle it on my own. Also the fuse in the house went out a few times. She was not happy and lied to me for it. The plumbing was bad as well and I had to put the microwave on the floor in the living room. She did let me check out later than normal check out but it was to clean her place. I was willing to rent long-term but honestly I’m so happy I didn’t she’s a good host. But doesn’t know how to run it well.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>We arrived very late at night because of problems with the rental car, I wish we had taken a cab because 2 hours after arriving the car was smashed right outside our window. Therefor DO NOT BRING A CAR TO THIS PLACE. We only stayed 2 nights then we moved on. We didn't feel safe. There is nothing wrong with the room, it was very nice and clean. The kitchen is very big and have everything you need in case you want to cook. The bathroom is not at all small but the shower didn't work and we could only have a bath in the tub, but it was ok, plenty of warm water. We had room A and there is a lot of noice the room because the window can not close because of the aircondition. Also because of the open window we were very cold at night and there was only 1 blanket, but I guess it's not a problem in the summertime.  If you are on a low budget and doesn't mind the unsafe streets at night this is a place to stay. It's very close to the ferry to Manhatten.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"It was a nice place to stay.

Really cute kitchen and it was nice to have self-catering facilities. The trucks from the depot opposite didn't bother us at night as we had ear plugs, so don't let it put you off! The bathroom is no worse than in a shared hotel in Manhattan, and would not stop us from going back again.

Full kitchen, bathroom with a great shower and plenty of hot water, cable TV (two TVs actually). You have to do a little climbing to get to the bed, but a very comfortable bed it was. Great neighborhood.  Funky East Village with excellent little cafes, bars, grocers, close to Soho, Galleries, Little Italy, Chinatown, easy access to the Metro and uptown. Really fun area.

There is even a fully equipped kitchen with many pots and big knives. If you're into cooking, with this place you can do what you mostly can't when visiting a city: go to the market (in this case the nearby farmers market on saturday), buy what you get and cook it yourself! Last but not least: Maya is a great landlady. Very communicative, very helpful and very charming. You can trust her tips for eating, drinking and shopping in the neighborhood, downwritten on a map: they're all very reliable. And: there were fresh flowers on the table when we arrived.

If you're a large person, like me, it's difficult to find enough room to use the toilet comfortably.

I have to start by agreeing with the comments left by the French family about 2 months ago. This house is NOT child friendly. The upper balcony does not have handrails that would conform to European Standards and would be considered wrong in any US State. This is the same for the stairs and handrails leading up. A child or a small adult could potentially fall through and be badly injured. This is a serious hazard and should not be ignored. As you arrive at the property the garden looks off putting as soon as you see it. The garden furniture was unusable, dirty, slimy and wet. The garden has an air of neglect add to that the gravestones and the look is of a disused cemetery, brilliant for Halloween but that is only one night in the year. To access the front door you have to walk through the yard area of another rental property, not too big a problem but the property we were in couldn’t be locked (also noted by other reviewers) and while the garden couldn't be penetrated by even the New York Fire Dept (once the first gate is locked) the property feels vulnerable. It would also invalidate any theft insurance should it be part of your holiday insurance cover. The fire pit is a grouping of stones in the middle of which ashes have been left. The pathway to the house is of flagstones, which are uneven and badly spaced. You couldn't push anything that is wheeled along it. The hammock is a nice touch, as are the outdoor lights and we were encouraged to pick apples. Inside the house is a pleasant surprise. The space is light and spacious. There is enough seating for 5 of us. But no bedding had been left for the fifth member of our party. The bed on the ground floor had hairs in it, (I wasn't told of this until the holiday was almost over, as our friends were too embarrassed) and the upper floor 5th person bed sagged because one of the support straps had snapped. There was no space for clothes for the three people on the upper floor so we had to move Olivia's clothes and belongings inside the wardrobe. While we appreciate and enjoy the reminders that we are in someone's home there was the sense that it had been walked out of rather than left ready. Our next problem was the upstairs toilet blocking. This we managed to fix, well before John came to do it. We also had to remove the plug in the sink upstairs. It was blocked and was full of hair. Not a nice job! The shower floor in the upper bathroom was dirty and trash had been left in the can....</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"wij hebben met veel plezier een week doorgebracht in dit appartement.

Her English is great.  At the end you tour a market and I did not realize she would make sure we tried a variety of snacks and we were able to get to know some of the vendors as well.

You can't do anything wrong if you stay with Tony! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The apartment is located in a ragged building and it, itself, presents a deterioration that does not appear at all in the advertisement: dirties floors and windows, worn-out bed linen, poor mattress, bad frying pans, etc.. Nevertheless the main problem of it is the hot:  the kitchen, restroom and a room do not have heating but a pipe goes through the wall from top to bottom to the upper stores making sometimes the heat unbearable which only can be remedied opening the windows even at midnight. Even worse is the situation in the main room, the only that counts on a radiator as this does not work but where, in spite of that, the hot water gets out to the room as water vapour through the stopcock making a noise similar to out of a device for spraying when functioning. To sum up, even if the kitchen and the shoer are correct, the apartment is not worth at all what it cost. \n66718,11762545,2014-04-14,10877634,Wendy,\"We were a group of 5 people being in Henning's apartment for almost a week.

Then the second day afternoon I had my lunch and went back to my room, surprisingly found him napping on my bed and had his food in my room. I asked him to give my more privacy by not entering my room during my stay while I'm not in the room because his behavior was making me feel like I was sharing the bedroom with him. He refused and said this is his apt he could do anything he want, if I can't accept this then I'll have to get out. I left the room immediately.

Jenna and Deroy were very quick to respond to inquires. The location was excellent and the value for the home was exceptional. We were in Brooklyn for my son's DIY wedding so our stay was distinctly different from a traditional vacation as it involved cooking for family, decorating a wedding cake, arranging flowers for the wedding.  The proximity to Whole Foods, which has a parking lot!!! was a terrific asset. Washer/dryer and dishwasher were a real plus. There were plenty of linens and towels. Access to the 2nd bedroom in the loft was impossible for me and my husband at 65 and 67 although this was my bad  for not reading the description more closely.  For a family from Texas the air conditioning was a blessing.  If you are planning to cook and serve dinner the kitchen is minimally stocked with dishes and cookware although the hosts offered to supplement items. We opted to use disposable tableware. A dinner table would have been a plus but again my bad for not reading the description more closely.

The next day, Pam had my jacket and bra (items that were soaked from the ceiling) dry cleaned on short notice and brought us fresh sheets.

Vernon was super easy to check in with. He was available via phone/text if we needed him, but everything was smooth and we never did!

As for the neighborhood, it's still a bit rough around the edges (tail end of Bed-Stuy near Bushwick) but it's really not bad. It is earlier in the gentrification process than Fort Greene or Clinton Hill so you don't have teh same plethora of trendy restaurants / organic food shops options right outside your door, but it is safe and close to convenient transportation.

It's also a 5- to 15-minute walk to any major train or bus stop, so you can travel throughout New York City pretty easily. Plus, the apartment was well furnished and very clean! But like any area in NYC, it's not perfect. While the area is safe overall, we did hear police and first-responder sirens at night almost regularly. Don't get me wrong, this is more a noise issue than anything else, as we felt safe throughout our stay. The community is transitioning into a cool little spot for couples and young families, with a lot of fun shops, cafes, and eateries.

Overall, my boyfriend and I were really happy with this listing! The apartment is pretty far north, so the commute to midtown Manhattan (where we spent a lot of our time) was pretty much the only drawback, but we were close to subway stops. We also didn't come back to the apartment during the day, so it wasn't really that bad at all. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My tour with Josué was amazing!

The hosts were very considerate and caring. I can tell that Alicia has a cool and open-minded family;I enjoyed a lot hanging out with her son and his interesting friends when I was in the apartment. They're very helpful from advising on the real-life-New-York spots and neighborhoods to helping me to locate the nearest decent nail salon in the neighborhood as I needed my nails done badly one day.. :p It was also interesting to have shared some fun time in the kitchen. I'd say the stay was definitely more than just an accommodating experience!

There were three separate airconditioners which were a welcome find (although the one in the main bedroom leaked onto the floor). Unfortunately the rest of our experience was not so positive. The description of the apartment and the photos did not match what we found. The apartment is certainly not brand new and was quite dirty when we arrived. There were some random bits of furniture and other items throughout the house and on the balcony which made it look untidy. The description didn't adequately capture the difficulty in getting into the apartment; lots of difficult to climb stairs, keys that got stuck (only one set of keys between four of us) and the need to traipse through another apartment's kitchen while going up to ours.

It was a very quick trip so I didn't really spend any time in the apartment, but I though it was a good value for the  money esp. in that location. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We loved Lauren's apartment and her magical cat Lola.

Her apartment is heated through out, and each morning we were able to make breakfast for ourselves (we are late risers but when Ivy was home she made the breakfast for us and wouldn't let us wash up!). On our last morning she made us some very delicious hot chocolate, which was a very nice send off indeed.

It was a cold evening in New York and once we got inside it was equally as cold. I searched for the thermostats and turned them all up. After wasting 30 minutes there was still no change in the temperature. I then texted the owner about what was wrong with the heat. When she replied she told me to turn thermostat off and that there are several space heaters in the place that we can use which will 'warm the place up in a few minutes'. Confused, I then asked what about the central heat and she then admitted it was not working and that her previous tenants did not complain. She also said that a technician was impossible to get during the holiday. Then upset I said we had all of the space heaters on and the place was still cold. Her next reply was that there was recently temperatures in the 20s and those tenants did not have a problem and there was nothing she could do. Very insensitive. I told her I was not happy and that that it was wrong for her to not to communicate this prior. She then still kept saying that previous occupants did not complain. Why? Then stated I could leave early and she would refund the difference. Not apologetic at all.  My family all slept with coats on. Horrible stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Place was great!

We had a group of eight and there was plenty of room for living space and sleeping. Staying at a historic Brownstone House was a beautiful experience, with the gorgeous 8ft ceilings & decorative molding just breathtaking. Two huge LCD TV's was a saving grace. No fighting over shows! Since the historic home has one HUGE Bathroom, all we had to do was work out a schedule & we had no problem using one bathroom. We toured all over Manhattan & we used the subway & buses for ALL our transportation. We bought a 7Day unlimited use MetroCard for each of us & it saved us a ton of money.

This apt is in brooklyn (dont get scared, the neighborhood is not that bad. It's not times square but it isnt bad at all!). The apartment was very cute and old school.

There is people walking around at night and during the day so there is nothing to be scared of!

Three of us stayed here for 5 nights and got about 2 hours sleep each night due to the noise from the shared apartment upstairs and outside. The first night, a random man walked into our room and the next night the people upstairs brought their friends home at 12:00am and again at 4:00am, yelling and continuing to drink in the shared kitchen. I slept on a futon which was like concrete so had to put an air bed on it while my other friends couldn't sleep because of the noise upstairs and from the street. This apartment is on top of a bar so the noise was terrible from all areas and we had to make our way past the druggies shooting up outside the apartment to get in. The shower is tiny and the toilet became blocked in the last morning but that was the lest of our worries compared to the noise.

No one called us so we could understand what was going on. We are really upset with this lack of consideration. And what they did with our stuff.

There's just one bathroom for the 3 people living in the flat, plus the guests, although this generally wasn't an issue. Our hosts were great communicators and getting in was easy, and we were able to leave our stuff there for the day when we left. My only niggle was the kitchen, which was really dirty. I took some bowls out of a cupboard to have cereal and had to wash them first because they had dried food inside. There was always dirty crockery sitting in the sink and the counter tops felt greasy and crumby. Inside the cupboards was dirty too, and the cooker had to be seen to be believed! I'm somewheat surprised as we paid a significant cleaning fee, as doubtless did the previous guests, and our bedroom was immaculate and the bathroom  fairly clean.

Vi nød hendes selskab og vi er sikre på, at det var gengældt. Hun tilbragte det meste af natten i vores seng. Vi var 5 voksne, og det fungerede fint i stuer og køkken. I soveafdelingen bliver det lidt mere trangt. Master bedroom og  bad er OK, men soveværelse 2 og 3 er mere egnet til et par teenagere. Hvis man er mere end to personer, skal man være opmærksom på, at man deler badeværelse med 'the caretaker'. Hun har ikke sit eget badeværelse, som der står et sted i beskrivelsen. Huset vil være perfekt til far og mor med 2 børn.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wonderful apt, clean.. spacious.. friendly staff... Everything was perfect!! Nothing else to say!!

Very nice, and we even had some tea and towels left. Matteo did a great job and is a nice guy. The apartment is right across the street from the police precinct so it felt pretty safe the whole stay.

The neighborhood is nice, it is mostly residential, and the walk to the subway is not bad at all, we felt comfortable and safe throughout our entire stay no matter the hour. Travel time to Manhattan is around 25 to 35 minutes using the subway during rush hour. There is a small convenient store across the street, restaurants nearby, really good pizza just a few steps from the home, and plenty of free parking on the street was available at all hours.

Just because its cheap doesn't mean its all bad. The location is great (middle of bedford just around the corner) and the set up is really good, there is pretty much a mini kitchenette with a fridge, cutlery, dishes, microwave, coffee and tea. The photos are a little blury but the room is quite big and was nice and warm (nice after the wintery cold outside), also they show 2 twin beds, this is what we were expecting but were pleasantly supprised when we arrived to a king bed (the 2 twins pushed togeather with a thick foam bed bridge) which was quite comfy. The room has its own bathroom accessed through a weird blocked off hallway, its clean enough and a little old but has good water pressure. There's some complaints in other reviews about smells from the kitchen, we only found this to be in the evenings (from the wierd hallway) and the smells were so delicious this only made us hungry, not angry so we just left to find our own dinner on the amazing Bedford ave. If you're on a budget like us, you must try Vanessa's dumplings! We walked from here to central park via cafe's, Union square market, Times square and many other places in between and was totally walkable if you're keen and fit! Overall totally worth staying here and your money goes towards Obeds daughters' education so its also for a good cause.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Michael is a wonderful host.

Our flight from Toronto was delayed due to bad weather and he had to come to the airport twice to pick us up and then on the way to the house gave us a night tour of NYC.

The check-in and check-out was smooth and easy. Sun was responsive via text and we didnt run to any problems in the house. The neighborhood was a bit sketchy and might make some people uncomfortable but we were ok with it. The house is located right above the metro station which was good due accessibility and bad because you hear metro noises in the living room area. Overall, we  recommend this place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I'm tempted to write a bad review so none of you stay at Farrah's and we get the place easily the next time we visit NY, but instead I'll be honest. Nestled in a happily less gentrified area of Brooklyn than we had imagined, Farrah's loft was a great place to stay. As opposed to the community-killing rentals offered by landlords with multiple offerings, it felt nice to be in someone's home. Add to that Farrah's insightful suggestions about Brooklyn nightlife and the easy access to all points NY given the subway practically at your doorstep, and air conditioning in the summer, it was a full win for us. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Excellent place.

I read many of the other reviews, not sure how other reviewers got the warm and fuzzy feeling from the host, we did not receive that sort of welcome.  Oh well I guess, everyone has bad days.

I always look at the bad ones first. Thank god I didn’t let it deter me because of all the good reviews and amazing location! From personal experience, I can definitively say the praise was well earned. The actual apartment is better than the pictures! I could not believe the location or the view. But most of all, the extra lengths my host went through to make my stay special. She made maps for me when I asked, was very informative and makes one hell of a green tea latte! But most of the time I could hardly tell if she was around or not. My only complaint is, the place was so comfortable I ended up spending more time than I had planned, indoors, then out. And my bedding was new, so it must have been replaced since the last review. I had a lot of privacy and this was just the escape I needed. Will definitely be back! Thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The place was not as represented. No bedroom just mattress on box springs on tiny living room floor 6 feet from kitchen where host was to cook her food while invading our privacy. It was so wrong and misrepresented we refused to stay and she refused to return our money. AirBnB won’t return our money without pictures we were supposed to have taken before we left to prove what we saw. They won’t investigate. So we are lying? We stayed in a full house inVirgin Gorda with AirBnB. this is how they treat  their customers</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>This apartment is in a convenient location close to Times Square (TS) and many subway lines.  It's up high enough in the building and a couple blocks away from TS that the noise is minimal. The view is truly outstanding!  Be sure to note that you are sharing a one bedroom apartment and you are in the living room on a full sized bed albeit with a spectacular view.  When you consider that this is the size of a typical hotel room, it is a good value.  The bathroom has some older tile in the bathtub area, but it is clean just worn. (I've stayed at many hotels in NYC where the bathrooms were smaller and the tile was in worse condition.)  Communication was excellent. Understand the house rules before you book - frankly, they are quite common in NYC (e.g., remove your shoes, don't open the windows). Again, be sure you read the details of the listing. I will stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>first time using airbnb and it was a blast! first of all I love the location, it takes a minute to get to Chauncey St (J train) and 10-12 minutes from Rockaway Ave (A,C train) and they'll bring you everywhere. The neighborhood's is not bad, since its only a half block away from Chauncey so I always transferred to J train just in case, I got back around midnight and there was no problem. The bed isn't as bad as I thought, sure its not a 'normal' bed but I slept like a log anyway. Check in and check out were easy. Evan was in the house when I arrived so he helped me with the luggage (yes there are 2 set of stairs but its not bad), and Danielle made me a cup of coffee before I left. I only stayed for 4 nights and I wish I could stay longer. If you're flying from JFK it takes only 30 minutes or so with Uber/taxi, and you can also take the train (J train then AirTrain). The big pro is the bathroom!! I'm kinda picky with bathrooms so having a private bathroom is a plus, and its very clean so there goes my 2 thumbs up! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great host, nice apartment and it’s very cool to have your own bathroom! I can highly recommend this place. The only downside, if any, is the way to Manhattan (approx. 30 minutes) but you have a good connection to JFK-airport and the possibility to use J-, L- and A-trains, so you have very flexible routing options. For my taste, the neighborhood looked a little bit depressing, at the first glance, but later I realized the whole town is in a bad condition and there’s no big difference to other parts of NY.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lovely apartment and great value. I felt immediately at home here and was sad to leave. I’d highly recommend this place. And what incredible Manhattan and Williamsburg bridge views! There is some city noise that comes from the bridge but it’s not bad and wasn’t a bother for me. Evan always responded super quickly too and leaves a very useful house manual as a nice thoughtful touch. Bear in mind that it’s about a 10-15 min walk to nearest subways or to get onto the bridge.

The room was clean and cozy. Too bad that I only stayed at this place for 1 night, I should've stayed longer! I really enjoyed the stay and definitely recommend to others.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>What a great place to stay! Everything was as described by Maya. We loved the neighborhood with easy access to the waterfront where we often enjoyed our morning coffee. Many restaurant and bars to enjoy close to the apartment. We didn't get to meet Maya in person but everything worked out very well and it seemed like she was on standby the whole week if something was wrong.  Strongest recommendations from here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"i had one of my best airbnb experiences at maya's! the place is lovely, full of light, confortable, cozy and super well decorated. communication was great, the neighborhood is charming and there's no bad thing to tell about this experience. \n211078,132059601,2017-02-15,7824729,Max,\"Absolutely amazing place. Very well decorated</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was clean and comfy. Location is great. My only problem was that the bathroom sink is very tall (up to my chest), which made it very hard for a short person like me to use. Also, the shower water temperature is very difficult to control so I ended up taking fairly cold showers (but fortunately the apartment was really warm so it wasn't too bad). The place is still a great deal though for a nice stay in NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Loved the space! Pattee and Babacar shared there cozy home and made sure that both my girlfriend and I were comfortable. This location is perfect for checking out the heart of the city on a budget. Great value and great people. You can't go wrong with this deal!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>\"The area is amazing with many grocery stores and super markets. The subway is literally next door. It is a vibrant location and just 20 mins from Times square. The half bathroom is very practical. Boubacar I am afraid though is very weird if not anything worse and talked me very aggresively on multiple occasions without actually any reason at all. He said things like \"\"oh you didn t sweep away a bit of water left out from tea\"\" </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jacqui's pad was my first time using Airbnb and it was definitely a great experience! It was really easy to get the process going and Jacqui responded almost immediately every time I had questions. Organizing our stay and getting the keys was a breeze! Jacqui sent us a detailed email with info about the apartment and the area; From Laundromats to grocery stores close by and amazing breakfast, coffee, brunch, lunch and dinner spots all walking distance from the apartment (not a single bad suggestion). Overall my stay was a success and I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan! So easy to get around with the Metro!!!! Until next time! XOXO</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We loved the apartment. It was close to bars and cafés and the apartment and the whole building was clearly well looked after. It felt spacious, with a separate living area, although the bed may feel a bit cramped if you're used to space. Lisa left us a key at a local grocery and was available to answer questions through our stay. The 3 flights of stairs don't feel that bad, but the nearest subway is 15-20 mins away. Don't feel afraid to use the city's bike hire scheme which is available around the corner!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The host is long on rules, and short on welcome.  Host had not sent me the key code, and I sat in the designated spot for over 40 minutes trying to reach her to obtain code.  Finally reached her; she raised her voice, cut me off, and implied that I had done something wrong in not HAVING THE KEY CODE.  This airbnb was so bare-bones.  Every other place I've stayed the host leaves a few necessities to help tide you over til you get to the store, and to make you feel welcome.  Not so here.  Heads up: Bring your own washcloth, soap, coffee grounds for first day, etc, etc, etc.  Inhospitable, unfriendly host. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Lisa's place is a true gem! \n220946,145516908,2017-04-18,75955353,Anna,\"Pen leilighet med alt man trenger av fasiliteter.

Even though the Lower East Side can get pretty hectic, it was nice to go back to a quiet and cozy apartment. Lisa is a very attentive and responsive host, and was particularly responsive around check-in and check-out. The only thing to look out for (and Lisa mentions this accurately in her description) is that the apartment is pretty far from any subway line. Not too bad once you get the hang of it -- and there are a few buses in the area -- but if you're planning on traveling by subway while in the city, it's worth thinking about. Otherwise, it's an awesome spot, and the neighborhood is great. We would definitely go back!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Lejligheden er rigtig fin, ren og rummelig med to gode soveværelser, dejligt fællesrum med køkken og tilmed egen udgang til en gårdhave med grilplads.

Rachel gav mange gode tips til spisesteder etc. Beliggenheden er god med små 1000 m til metroen, lige på kanten til Chinatown. Gode metroforbindelser til andre steder på Manhattan. Gåafstand over Williamsburg broen til bydelen Williamsburg, hvor Bedford Avenue er et rigtig fint shoppingområde. Ungt og hipt! Lækre små spisesteder. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Marina is an excellent host, very friendly and easy to deal with. At the stage of arranging the visit she responded to my questions immediately and she proved to be equally reliable when I arrived. Everything worked well in her apartment and she was eager to provide any information I needed. The journey to Manhattan, although rather long (around an hour and a half), did not feel that bad, perhaps because the ferry trip was very nice, especially on a hot summer day. That was my first AirBnB experience and I think I was lucky to find such a lovely host. I do recommend Marina's apartment to everyone! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I guess we had different expectations than the other reviewers. The place is a mess. Moldy smell (so bad that we slept with the window open even though it was below freezing). Doors, walls and carpets were dirty. It was not even safe: steep stairs without railing, gas stove not functioning well in a room without windows, cracked tiles. The bathroom was a nightmare, </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The apartment is very clean and ok if you're only looking for somewhere quiet to sleep and will not spend time inside. On the other hand, if you're looking for a place to live and cook, it's quite dangerous since the first oven isn't heating and just leaking gas when you turn it on and the 2nd one (electric) is almost unreachable for someone 5'3 and I burned myself with its door that is as hot as the inside even with gloves on. Many basic kitchen tools were missing (scissors, oven gloves, cutting board, soap, blender,...) and I had to buy most of them. The hosts are rather polite and they repaired everything that broke quickly (the fridge and AC were not working and it was really hot, windows were locked at first, it is not the sunny apartment described). If you're looking for people who won't talk to you (so no instruction given about anything but they definitely will send you a complain e mail if you put something in the wrong garbage can for example) and respect your intimacy (which is good because the lock doesn't work from inside), this place is for you. Otherwise, it won't be a very friendly air bnb atmosphere despite all your efforts to get along with them. Moreover, I wouldn't recommend Staten Island since it's very tiring to live so far from most places and you have to take a bus to the ferry (it takes 30 minutes + another 30 minutes on the ferry to Downtown) and the bus is often late. So, living somewhere else, closer to Brooklyn or Manhattan and paying a bit more would have been worth it in the end.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Begin oktober verbleven wij een week bij Marilyn.

El apartamento es muy amplio, cómodo y luminoso, tal y como se recoge en la descripción o incluso mejor. Estaba limpio y cuenta con todo lo que se puede necesitar en una casa. Las camas son muy cómodas, sobre todo la de matrimonio y aunque se comenta que está en zona ruidosa, la verdad es que a nosotros no nos ha molestado el ruido, ni el de la calle ni el del karaoke de abajo. Se notó algo más de ruido durante las noches de viernes y sábado. La cocina muy completa incluso con lo imprescindible para cocinar y desayunar el primer día. Daniel fue muy amable tanto cuando llegamos como dejándonos estar en el apartamento hasta las 5 pm ya que el vuelo lo teníamos a las 8:45 pm. El portal sorprende un poco al principio pues da a la salida de emergencia del karaoke, pero lo importante es el apartamento. La zona muy céntrica, llegas a muchos lugares andando y tiene dos líneas de metro a una distancia aceptable. Además hay una parada de autobús justo en frente, aunque nosotros no lo hemos utilizado. Hay varios supermercados en la zona abiertos permanentemente. Lo recomendaría sin ninguna duda</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You could’nt go wrong with this one in Brooklyn.  It is very cozy, neat, and clean and you will feel like it is an extension of your own home the moment you step in.  The host is an amazing person and very accommodating to our needs.  We also find the neighborhood safe and worry free.  We had a wonderful stay and we really miss the place already!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The volcano is absolutely stunning, and the sunrise is far and away the best I have ever seen (such a magical experience to be above the clouds!!) We were slightly blighted with bad luck in that it was a cloudy night and so there were only a few stars visible, and a few of our group suffered quite badly with altitude sickness meaning that Almos had to stay behind with them and the rest of us did half of the hike by ourselves. The trail was really easy to follow, so this wasn't too much of a problem, but it did throw off our timings a bit, meaning that some of the group didn't reach the top for sunrise. It's definitely worth bringing lots of warm clothes as the wind chill on the way up is no joke. All in all a fantastic experience, but maybe could have been improved with two tour guides so that the group could easily be split if needed.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I have not one bad thing to say about the nearly four weeks I spent at Jim's place. Jim's profile, including others' reviews, are an accurate depiction of what to expect from Jim and his apartment. He was very easy to deal with from the start, a delight to speak with when our paths would cross, checked in by text (when we hadn't run into each other in a while) to make sure I had everything I needed, and made me feel welcome at all times throughout my stay. The apartment is amazingly located, quiet and peaceful when I needed a break, but close enough both by subway or foot to all New York has to offer (the neighborhood itself provided endless culinary adventures). Nothing would make me happier than to be able to stay at Jim's again. It would be like returning home.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Wow, where to start?! This place was great! There is a beautiful view from the bedroom window with lots of light and the room is really nice and has a good amount of space! It’s in a GREAT location, close to anything you might need (restaurants, the subway, Times Square, theatre,etc)! Tim was the best and was easy to communicate with and answered any questions I had. Probably my favorite Airbnb ever. Nothing bad to say :) </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Civan's place was great! Very comfy stay and it was very clean! The area was great and it was not a bad subway ride into the city! Subway stop is literally right beside the apartment!

As said by previous guests the house is quite noisy, but nothing more that everyday life noises such as kids running upstairs and occasional car noises from the road. The apartment was quite cold but I think it was just the wrong time of the year because NY was in general quite chilly.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment is very nice, clean, bright, and in a great location.Great kitchen if you want to cook. I can't say anything bad about it. Jens was a very nice host and was available when we had questions about the tv during our stay.

The photos were very misleading. The three of us are in very good shape and the steers were tiring. The unit was small, noisy,  and uncomfortable.

Dicht bij een metrolijn (local stop van rode lijn 1), en in een leuke gezellige woonbuurt. Het contact met de verhuurder Emmett verliep geheel via internet, maar ging goed. Het appartement was goed schoon, en met 4 slaapkamers en 2 badkamers ideaal voor een grotere groep of gezin. Voor bedlinnen en handdoeken werd gezorgd, en het keukentje had wat servies, glas, en pannetjes. De keukenkastjes onderin waren niet schoon, de rest wel. De bedden waren goed en comfortabel. Er zijn enkele nadelen, ook al wegen die niet op tegen de voordelen: 1. de straat en de buurt zijn luidruchtig, met veel verkeer en uitgaans geluid op vrijdag- en zaterdag-avond en -nacht, en iedere keer dat de metro onder het huis door rijdt, voel je het rammelen. 2. Het appartement en al het interieur is redelijk versleten. 3. De huurprijs is fors, en op het niveau van 2 of 3 hotelkamers. Neem je dat allemaal voor lief dan heb je een leuke vakantie in the west village, een aanrader.\n248871,147418585,2017-04-26,73528170,Sarah,\"Emmett (host) gives you suggestions for area eateries</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>If you want a quintessential New York experience whether traveling for work or play, you cannot go wrong with Emmett’s place.

Check out The Garrett on the corner for a speakeasy sipper or across the street to Bleecker Street Pizza for a late night slice (or anytime of day, let’s be honest...)</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Location can't be beat. We worried that it would feel cramped with 7 guests, but we were totally wrong. Even with 7 adults it felt spacious with the 2 bathrooms and 2 common areas to go with 4 separate bedrooms. It's all spread across 2 floors which I think helps.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>One of the highlights of my stay in Siena. The food and wine was outstanding and the hospitality was incredible.

The apartment is enormous for nyc and has a great open living room/kitchen.  The master bedroom is at the opposite end of the apartment and very private.

Even though she wasn't in Brooklyn during my stay, she answered my texts fast (much faster than what I expected when she told me she was away). Great location! Nothing bad to say about Cynthia nor her place!! </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Promising option in Brooklyn with relatively new, fully furnished (everything IKEA) accommodation which is spacious for NYC. Unfortunately my stay was completely ruined by a billing dispute between AirBnB and the host, which led to a request for me to pay for my entire stay again, on day 4 of my 1 month stay. All this after my credit card had been charged for the full stay weeks before my arrival. After 3-4 days of arguments and discussion between all parties AirBnb and the host resolved the billing dispute. However, in the interim period I hated every minute of being at this property. I was fearful that either my credit card would be charged a second time by the host, or worse, I would return to the room to find I had been locked out. Treatment that I received was woeful and extended to not only being treated like a criminal, but being accused of being in the US illegally. I travel a lot for business, all over the world, and I would rate this my worst hotel experience of all time! I would have left earlier, however my request to cancel, with refund, was declined. For those looking for connectivity beware. The rooms have no telephones, there is free WIFI, but it is very patchy with frequent periods of no availability (up to whole days with no WIFI). All compounded by patchy (mostly no connectivity) to mobile networks (voice or data) from both T-Mobile and AT&T in the rooms. If you are looking for complete seclusion in NYC, with an inability for anyone to contact you in the rooms, then this could be the place for you. The rooms appear relatively new, but are still experiencing teething issues from initial construction. In my case, it included an exploding (and I mean violent explosion) glass shower screen door in the middle of the night. It literally sounded like a bomb going off, and I am sure woke not only me, but everyone else in nearby rooms. When I ventured into the bathroom - every inch of the room was covered in thousands of pieces of shattered safety glass. Leaving me with an unusable bathroom, until I changed rooms the next morning. To his credit the night manager was very apologetic and did accommodate with immediate access to another room, pending the move. The Hotel is located in an industrial street within an easy walk of two train lines. The 7 train is a walk across the Pulaski bridge which includes a climb up 4 flights of stairs which would be a challenge for some. The bridge is noisy, exposed to weather and frequented by heavy traffic. The amenities of Greenpoint, including restaurants and convenience stores, are within an easy 5-10 minute walk providing some reasonable options for eating and limited supplies. Onsite laundry (reasonably priced) and gym facilities (free) are a good convenience for those staying longer. I can understand why others do enjoy - but overall horrible experience for...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Given that deception is the name of the game in the NY hotel world one would hope to escape it through Airbnb. This is not a loft but a hotel with loft-like rooms. Had I know this was what I was booking I would have looked for something else. Location is very bad and under the Pulaski bridge. Staff on the other hand were very friendly and helpful, although one couldn't help but catch the irony in their smile as they sold a very inauthentic Ikea version of loft living in BK. </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>All the glowing reviews about Roger and his apartment turned out to be spot on and well deserved. This is a nice room in a neat neighborhood and Roger is a great host. This proved to be a perfect base camp for exploring Bushwick and beyond. Roger's guidebook is a great tool to help get acquainted with the local area. You can't go wrong by booking with Roger.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Antonio is a fantastic host. Easy to reach before and during my stay, he provided comfort and a lovely apartment for my trip. He is also accommodating - he allowed us an early check-in and had the apartment cleaned the night before for we arrived. His place is clean and well-furnished, not to mention easily accessible by car or subway. There are plenty amenities that help longer stays like a lovely kitchen and washer and dryer. The beds were comfortable and the rooms easy to cool or warm depending on the weather. The neighborhood, though not aesthetically pleasing, wasn't bad and is close to the G train. Overall a wonderful deal and a pleasure to stay at.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This Airbnb was a great pick for our short trip to NYC.

First (and most importantly!) the apartment was immaculate.  It was in a great location, and I absolutely loved the space.  Second, Ro was kind, caring and extremely helpful. He was helpful with my past-midnight check-in, and when I went to the wrong address the first time, he was available by phone to help and made sure that I had arrived at the apartment safely.  I am so appreciative of his kindness.  This is the first place I would stay when I come to NYC again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"We had a pleasent stay at RO apartment.

When I first arrived, it was bad timing because she was at work and I needed to get the keys to the apartment. She so easily met with me to give them while at work, so she is VERY flexible with your check in time! Upon arriving at the apartment, it's exactly as described. Everything was perfect! You have your own private entrance to your bedroom straight from the outside and then a sliding door that's right beside the bathroom, leads to the narrow hallway down to the kitchen, and across is Dominique's bedroom. East village is a great and safe place to stay. It's busy but not THAT busy; it's pretty chill. The apt is also very close to subway stations, boutiques, and awesome eaterys. Also, if you need any tips Dominique will totally help you. She's so sweet! So yah, overall if you're looking for a place to stay in Manhattan, definitely stay here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dominique was incredibly helpful and efficient in responding to my request! The space was exactly as described with a flood of sunlight during the day and a private entrance in and out of the room. I read about other visitors concerns about the smell of smoke, however I only encountered it when I would pass by that neighbor on the walk up, so it really wasn't as bad as others had made it seem. The neighborhood itself is located near some fun bars and restaurants and the walk to the subway stops were definitely manageable. I'm so grateful Dominique was able to set this room up on such short notice! </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dominique was nice and accommodating. She had a towell ready for me and the room was clean. However, I hate to give bad ratings but I have to be honest: the nightly rent is way overrated. It's definitely in a nice area but the room was very cold (mid-october, and no way to close the broken window). If I hadn't brought my own cover and wool socks, I would have had quite a bad night. The WiFi also only worked when in the kitchen so there's no wi-fi available really.. And she decided to make herself a smoothy... at 1:30 am. She used her blender twice for a while and made a lot of noise in the kitchen.. it woke me up twice. I went to see her and she kindly apologized. But for the price... definitely wasn't the best unfortunately.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a very bad experience and chose not to stay there</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td> Catherine's home is a work of art in itself-- such attention to detail, color, texture and functionality --it's just plain fun to be there and a real pleasure to live in among the outstanding portraiture she has hung on her walls. Spotlessly clean. Catherine left easy to follow notes on how to operate TVs, cable, air conditioning, locks and a wonderfully detailed notebook describing the neighborhood, including brochures from the many and good local eateries, shops, drug stores, medical services, subway, all just  3 short blocks away from this residential neighborhood bordering leafy Riverside Park. A quart of milk, eggs, orange juice, chilled filtered water,  coffee + machine, along with a basket of fresh fruit & a split of champagne, greeted us weary travelers, grateful to be able to unpack and fall into bed--king size & comfy--without having to go out.  Catherine makes herself very accessible, a comfort in case something goes wrong--which it did not.  We found it easy to get from her apartment to where we were going--theatre district, High Line, Whitney, Guggenheim, Neue and Natural History museums.  Given the chance, we would definitely stay with Catherine again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Well I can not tell to much from the apartment I was just two days there.

He even offered to pick up his guests from the airport and let them check in on arrival even though it was at an ungodly hour of the morning.  Although I did not stay at the apartment, I 've heard that it was comfortable and pleasant and that Kevin was a most charming host.

Very friendly, willing to do anything for you.

He understood my flight times and allowed for early/ late check in/out.  Place was what I expected. Was constantly told by locals that I was in a bad area but for 3 Males staying here we never felt unsafe.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First off, the host is very nice, very concerned that everything goes well. The location is really good. The apartment is in Midtown East - very close to Rockefeller center, Times Square, Grand Central station, Madison/Park/5th avenue shopping, Central Park, Broadway. Outside the apartment is fantastic eateries, so you don't have to go far, and late night deliveries. There is a door man, who makes guests register - so you feel safe that they are aware of people who come in and out of the building. He makes it a point to know the people who come in and out of the building. Very safe location. Lots of people walking around, foot traffic, I felt safe as a single girl walking around even late at night. The price is fantastic, very good considering the area. Considering where you are - you would pay a lot more for hotel or other forms of accommodations - remember 'location, location, location'. Apartment is very comfortable - there is a bed, couch, kitchen, bathroom. Host had a lot of books around, so you can be entertained if you like that kind of thing. Bad sides were: the place was not very clean - dusty, sheets were old and dingy, shower curtain was moldy, towels smelled bad. Host was nice enough to leave laundry supplies - so I washed the linens and towels, so I was ok with that. I had to do some cleaning to feel comfortable. There is no microwave, so hard to heat up leftovers, but most of the time I ate out anyway, so was not an issue. There was no TV. I had my laptop so I could watch Netflix, and I was there to explore NYC anyway, not watch TV. Overall, I thought it was a great place. There was an air conditioner, so the temperature was always comfortable. I would recommend this to others if you are on a budget, and are easy going so that minor inconveniences don't bother you. The only minor inconvenience I had was I had to do some light cleaning to feel comfortable, perhaps the host would have this rectified before the next person visits. The host was easy to get a hold of, could easily be contacted within 24-36 hours via email. Responds to calls/texts.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Phenomenal little apt. Cozy and clean. Communication was great; spoke little but, AJ always made me welcomed if i ever needed anything or had questions that I could reliably contact him.

I had to call AJ to resolve the issue, and he helped me find the right door. The neighborhood is welcoming and clean everything was within 30 min walk. Museum of sex, blood manor, banks, and places to eat. Would definitely book with AJ again if given the chance. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Overall had a great stay at AJs place.

Keow was instantly responsive via text to any questions. She met us on time and transferred the keys.  You know a place is super lean when you can wear new white socks (forgot the slippers) and they showed no floor dirt or grit at all.  A fresh dish sponge in a wrapper spoke to cleanliness. Ample, quiet fridge. The big king bed was super comfortable. Despite being across the road  from a sunken freeway, the place was an oasis of calm. The  second and third folding beds were like futons - very comfortable. The pots of herbs in the back garden patio added to a few dinners we cooked there.  It was a four block walk to the main drag - Smith Street with cafes and small shops between plus clean residential streets. Very friendly neighbours. Going anywhere by subway was about 40 minutes - not too bad either to Manhattan or other parts of Brooklyn on the F train.  There is an amazing walk relatively nearby to the Brooklyn Promenade.

We were not disappointed.  It was absolutely perfect for what we needed.  There was parking available on the street for the band's van which was a huge plus!  We were literally right around the corner from the venue.  The band had to come a go in between sound checks, video shoots, meet and greets, and the actual shows and it was no problem to go back and forth all day.  The room was so spacious that it was easy to have a videographer and reporter come in for an interview.  We also brought in quite a bit of musical equipment so that it didn't stay in the van on the street and there was plenty of room and no one seemed bothered by us bringing in so much stuff!  Everyone that came through our room commented on how awesome it was.  The front desk staff was very helpful with recommendations for places to get drinks or food and also arranged a car to take me to the airport.  There is a really awesome grocery store right on the corner that I went to everyday to pick up snacks and drinks.  I have not one bad thing to say.  I actually hope that I have an excuse to stay again in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The communication with the host is easy and friendly. We had even check out time moved due to our late flight departure. The guests should expect to share the flat with another guests and not the host as such. The location is very convenient with subway close by. The pictures of the flat are a bit dated. We struggled with the cleanliness though. The bedroom was quite ok with dust around the bed and on the mattresses. The bathroom and kitchen were worse than we expected. And we faced cockroaches on repetitive occasion. Even though the host dealt with the issue the cockroaches were still appearing mainly in the bathroom but also in the kitchen and the bedroom.

First, the place was so dirty, dusty, w/ cat fur ALL OVER the place, specially the rugs, we did not dare to touch our feet on the ground. I can't even begin to describe the smell: even though the weather was cold, we just left the window opened (w/ a support as it wouldn't stay opened on its own). The bathtub and bathroom curtains were so filthy they left the water a black-brown color when we tried to wash them. The kitchen utensils were extremely greasy, and we didn't even dare to use the appliances as they were covered in a black mass, whatever it was. The shower was either too cold or too hot! Don't stay here if you have children, are elderly, disabled in any way, or carrying any baggage as the 4 flights of insanely steep and narrow stairs are to die for!!! The landlord will take prospective tenants to the apartment (so annoying!). The aerobed would deflate completely during the night, which left me w/ severe back pain. On our first day Brian (the host) was really rude! He apologized later, but his actions were, at least, unprofessional. As you can see, there were so many problems we decided not to complain to Brian about any, he obviously knew about them... We just decided to warn the AirBnB community not to make the same mistake we did and book this place.

We wished the TV was upgraded to a smart TV but we were rarely there so it wasn't missed much. The area is amazing and we had a very enjoyable time.

I take this trip to New York annually to get away from everything and I would absolutely stay there again without question. Kensington is perhaps the most peaceful neighborhood I've ever stayed in...probably in my entire life.

Being so close to the subway and not far from so many places on Bedford Ave. in Brooklyn was great.  Getting back and forth to Manhattan was so easy.  Our family wedding was just blocks away so we were in the perfect location.  Climbing the stairs was not even all that bad.  Parking on his street ended up easier than I had feared, just as he had assured me.  Although we did not get to meet James, he was more than helpful throughout our stay just as he had been prior to our arrival.

The neighbourhood is pleasant and very quiet at night, it felt safe. It is very close to a metro stop, so very convenient to get around. The kitchen was nice, and it you want self catering, it has everything there, and the bay windows are very pleasant to sit and eat breakfast at. The kitchen and bathroom is clean and well stocked. The bedroom was clean enough but a bit dusty, perhaps not clean enough for some. The room was small and simple, but the cupboard big, and reasonable for the cost for three. The lock on the front door was flimsy and felt insecure. The lock on the bedroom door did not lock at all; this was a problem to leave our stuff open to others, and unfortunately this was not fixed while we were there - but I expect this will be fixed soon and I hope this will not be an issue for others in future. We did not see the management at all during our stay, all instructions were by email, which I personally found odd, but maybe this is normal for others, so there was no check in, no check out, so no real welcome at all. Strange, but I guess not bad. If this is the sort of accommodation you  are expecting, then this place is a good lower price option.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was a great location!

Before booking, Pat reply the soon and answer the questions quite in detail, but after that, not always reply message and answer the phone. when we send him message to say the room is cold, It takes a whole night to get his reply. additionally, the trash truck is really noise in early morning. But the price is fair, and finally the heater problem is solved, so basically not a bad experience.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Patrick’s flat is indeed a stunning artists retreat. Super cute and cosy in the most perfect location. You couldn’t pick a better area. Next to my favourite food place in the world. Whole Foods. This place has everything! And I mean everything you could need to eat or drink. There was everything you could need in the house. Great supply of kitchen utensils etc. Big screen with Netflix and HBO was great for my son. The beds are super comfy. You can hear the traffic below but that didn’t bother us. I quite enjoyed hearing the sounds of New York. As others have written the floors are super creaky! We eventually got used to that and it is an old building so it’s expected. And yes the stairs are wonky and steep so if you have back issues and no one to help with your bags you might want to keep this in mind or be prepared for it on arrival. Also you can’t store your bags there when checking out at 11 so if you have a much later flight you need to store your luggage at a storage facility which isn’t near the flat and you have to pay for that. Couldn’t find one in Brooklyn. Maybe I’m wrong there but this part was challenging. Overall a great place to stay and escape the madness of the city. A true Brooklyn experience!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>BEWARE, this is a private room, not an entire house.

Getting access to the apartment was very easy since there's a code on the door. However we were disappointed by a couple of things. First of all the host was not available to greet us or help us getting around and also there were delays for him to respond to our emails. Second of all he did mention that we would have access to a a/c unit if we needed it. We requested one but the host was away and no one could help us with that and it was really hard for the 4 of us to deal witth the heat in that tiny apartment during the day.

I have stayed in enough different places to understand the sooner or later you will encounter good, bad and horrible places, it is inevitable. But in this occasion, I do feel the need to point out certain aspects that will give you a better perspective of what the place is. First of all, this is NOT an entire home so you do not have the freedom you would have in an entire home. You will be staying in a room of the house that has been transformed into a \"\"house\"\".

Fantastic stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Susan's apartment is in a very good location, close to everything. You have many restaurants nearby and when you leave the building you have the subway entrance of lines 2 and 3. Walking about 5 minutes there is also the Atlantic and Barclays Center station with connections to the lines 2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, M, N, Q, R. The apartment has two bedrooms and a bathroom. It is on the second floor of a building without an elevator. It's important that you know if you have heavy luggage. It is VERY important for Susan not to wear shoes inside the apartment. One of the first days I forgot and he scolded me for that. The room is spacious and has a lot of storage space if you are going to be a long time (I was two months). The closet (you can only use half) has hangers if you need them. It has a desk and a chair (be careful with it when leaning because the base is detached from the seat). The air conditioner works well and there is also a small fan. The street is quite noisy, but tolerable. I got used quickly. The first days I used earplugs and then I forgot them. The bed and pillows didn't seem completely comfortable, because I'm used to hard mattresses and pillows with memory foam. Susan gave me a large towel and two small ones. The cleanliness of the sheets and towels runs on your own. The large towel should only be hung in the room and not in the bathroom. The cleaning of the room and the apartment is done every 15 days. The cleaning lady is one of the sweetest and most charming people I have met during my trip to New York. Susan works from home, so you need to be really quiet. If you need to talk on the phone and she is working, I recommend closing the door of the room. Or if you need to listen to music or watch videos, it is better that you do it using headphones so as not to disturb. If you plan to cook in the apartment it is important to know several things. Among them you can't cook (or do things in the kitchen) after 10 o'clock at night, or even a little earlier, because the kitchen noise filters into Susan's room and does not let her sleep. Susan will give you a small space in the pantry and in the fridge to store your food. If you are used to buy a lot of food, this could be a problem. Susan asks you to wash the cans and even the containers of yogurt or food that you are going to throw away because she feels that the garbage gets a bad smell. It is also important that you ask what things in the kitchen you can use. I had to buy a pan because the one I could use was not in good condition....</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location was not bad. Ginger was out of town and we met previous guests.

And there was no hot water. We were waiting her reply but hard to get it because she was not in the states. First night we couldn't sleep and it was hot and sticky in the room with not really clean bedding and we had to take a shower only cold water.

I would also invite you to take the time to talk with Mark as he has a very good knowledge of his neighbourhood and is a very interesting and kind person.   </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I stayed at Mark's place for 11 days in November and thoroughly enjoyed every day there. Everything was exactly as described, maybe even better. The rooms appeared as they do in the photos. No unpleasant surprises. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and cozy rooms and I immediately felt at home. Nice to have my own kitchen and the fully equipped bathroom is on the same floor, just a few steps down the hallway. Coffee, tea and other essentials were available in the kitchen. Mark even offered me a bowl of fantastic homemade apple sauce that tasted incredible. Mark was a very friendly and helpful host. He was quite happy to talk, which I enjoyed -- he's a nice guy with a great sense of humor, but completely respected my privacy and left me to myself most of the time, which was perfect for me because I also had to work during my stay. He has great knowledge of and enthusiasm for his neighborhood which I can understand. The area is quiet which was a nice contrast to long and hectic days in Manhattan. I never felt threatened or in danger no matter how late I returned home via nearby Utica subway station. I've heard that some people perceive this as a \"\"bad\"\" neighborhood but that couldn't be more wrong. The inhabitants are very friendly and smile and say \"\"hello\"\" when you pass them in the street. If you do the same</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Rimma & Jim’s place is in a good neighbourhood.

Close to the trains, etc. Great, lively neighborhood. Great kitchen. The bed though was so uncomfortable that it kind of ruined it for me.

My back is pretty badly impaired after sleeping on it for multiple nights. I was also rushed out the door at the end when the cleaners showed up 45 minutes before my checkout & I didn't even get a chance to put the dishes away. It was kind of disappointing as I feel like that's a lot of money to spend & there isn't even a decent place to sleep. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amazing host!

However, as soon as we arrived at the apartment, everything began to feel a lot better for us. The room is simple and nice and clean, and it is everything we needed. We shared the bathroom with another family and it worked out pretty well. Jose told us that the neighborhood has really bad lighting at night, but in fact it is pretty safe to walk in the neighborhood anytime of the day.

The room is warm as well as the bathroom. The price wasn't that bad since part of it went to the Airbnb website. The location was perfect since we could walk less than 5 min to get a subway, which I think it was one of the most used (number 4), and there were 3 or more groceries stores next to Jose's place. Also, at the end of our time in there, Jose offered himself to drive us to the airport which was very nice since we had heavy luggages with us.

Great communication with Elaine and fast responses</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great location and safe neighborhood but we were left really a really unpleasant taste in our mouth from the host, Joe. I’ve stayed in many Airbnb’s all over the world and usually don’t have very high standards. Some are good, some are okay. I would say I’m very easy to please. Upon checkout Joe charged us an extra $20 because we were “15 minutes late.” We were inside waiting for the cleaning person to arrive (since we were told she would show up at 11am.) after not hearing her arrive we looked for her outside and sure enough there she was talking in her phone sitting on the ground. We were left with a very unpleasant ending to our trip. We felt the communication was not clear with this late charge and it was handled unfairly. First bad review I’ve left after many visits all over the world.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jennifer was super accommodating after I had an unexpected/pretty bad allergic reaction to her cats (who are very cute but couldn’t stay because of the allergy). She asked a housekeeper to come the morning after and had the space cleaned out thoroughly to avoid another reaction. Once that was taken care of, the stay was perfect. The location is amazing— steps from some of the best coffee shops and restaurants in the city. Overall I couldn’t have asked for a better host or a better spot to stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Joris' apartment is definitely private and affordable. Joris was a very good host providing very detailed instructions for finding the apartment and obtaining the keys. He was very responsive to every communication and our needs. The living room was a little warm at times but it was also a very hot week when we were in NY. It took us longer than 20 min on the subway to get into Manhattan but still not bad. We enjoyed staying in Queens and getting out of the city. Convenient to both LGA and JFK. Overall a nice place and good value. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This room and rate are a terrific value.  Great location with lots of stores nearby as well as the metro.  Didn't take too long to get to Manhattan.  Sharma was great to talk to and responded promptly to all my questions.  He even let me rent out the room for extra nights on last-minute notice, which I appreciated very much.  Apartment and room were in good condition.  Bed was fine.  I'm giving four stars instead of five because of a couple things: the common area of the apartment had a bad food smell during my stay (my room was okay).  That isn't totally Sharma's fault, it was the other tenants.  And the floor of the apartment and my room were not totally clean.  The other reason for the four star rating is because my bedroom was not completely sealed off from the bedroom next door.  There is a square opening near the ceiling separated by a grate, so although you can't see anything, you can hear everything, and I had to go buy some earplugs.  But once I bought those, I slept soundly.  Again, this place is a great value if you're looking to save money.  I'll return on my next audition trip.  Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Horrible experience. The room had flies and bad smell. There was no ventilation and dust all over the windows. I passed one night and decided not to stay there anymore. I told the host that I altered the reservation and I will pay for one night. He didn't say anything at that time and said its ok. Later on, he decided against it. On top of that, he tried to be smart and started putting all the blame on me and my wife that something went wrong between us. Very unprofessional and unethical. \n448049,24556833,2014-12-30,20371640,Anne,\"Sharma as host was very polite and friendly. The room was kept at a relatively warm temperature.

It was everything we could have imagined and more. Perfect location - 20 Min walk to pretty much everything in the city, we hardly took rides anywhere! David was kind and responsive, and made us feel well taken care of - especially because they had tea! :) we will be back!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You can't go wrong staying in Greenwich Village. It's such a great, laid back, walkable neighborhood - and the restaurants can't be beat. David's apartment is charming, clean as a pin and cozy.  We enjoyed our weekend there a lot. David and his family were great hosts. They were very flexible with our goofy arrival and departure schedule, which meant a lot to me. They are experienced AirBnB'ers and it shows. There are many small touches that added a lot to our experience. We got the apartment to ourselves for the weekend as David was out of town. But be aware that the apartment is quite small (as described) and a Share weekend would not allow for much privacy, imo. Also, everything in the apartment description by David is true - the slanted floors, tiny bathroom and five flights of steps. If any of that puts you off, I wouldn't recommend staying at this place. But, if you're ok with those quirks, then you won't find nicer hosts or a better spot in the Village. I would stay again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First of all, I want to say that this space is a great value. It was a great setup for two travelers with the minimal things we required. We did not cook, and really didn’t spend much time in the apt except for sleeping. The 4th floor walk up isn’t bad, and the view and location is amazing with a quick walk to subway. The key kiosk worked fine for us and we experienced no issues with check in or check out. Despite the basketball court across the street and the club next door, we didn’t notice abnormal levels of noise, just normal nyc street traffic. It is a studio plus bathroom, and is smaller than it looks in photos. Now for a couple of small issues. First, there was only one bath towel in the apartment, despite our reservation for 2. The bathroom was missing a lightbulb, which can be a safety hazard, and finally, the spare blanket was covered in stains. For a couple of young people who didn’t spend much time in the apt, just needed a place to crash, this was a great place, and a great value considering the location (a similar unit in the building rents for 2200/month) but I definitely wouldn’t bring my parents here with the issues we noticed. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"We stayed at Sue's place for 1 week.

Agnes had provided lots of extra amenities such as various snacks and bottled water as well. The air conditioner worked well and the shared bathroom was clean. Agnes was also very kind and attentive about providing information about lots of things to see in New York City. Agnes also did not yell at us when we mistakenly went to the 7th floor (the roof) in trying to find her apartment and an enormously loud alarm sounded--at 2 am. I personally felt somewhat bad about having to wake Agnes up since we got in to NYC quite late, but she was gracious about it. As promised, the area was convenient to the subway and the express train made travel down to the main tourist areas quite quick.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Agnes made me feel very welcomed from the moment I got there.  She was a wonderful host and the accommodations were very easy to settle into.  She opened her kitchen to me with her unbelievable selection of teas and coffee.  Here introduction to the neighborhood gave me the confidence to venture out and about on my own without reservation.  She recommended several eating spots and I have to say one of my best parts of the trip was that I didn't have a bad meal the entire time.  If you are brave enough to jump on the subway, Agnes is like a walking map of the transportation system in New York and she will send very specific instructions how to navigate the routes.  Agnes is a great person to sit and talk with as she has some great life experiences to share.  She will be my first choice should I make another trip to New York.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Agnes was absolutely wonderful!! I arrived very early and she allowed me to drop off my bags while I wandered the city. She had complimentary beverages, and a great wealth of knowledge about the area (ask her about her building, very cool stuff folks). She was okay with my bright and bubbly morning personality. All around the best AirBnB spot I've stayed at yet. The next one I'm in the city I will be staying with her, she made what was starting off to be a bad trip end a beautiful one!

She kindly gave us the privacy we hoped to have. She was always in touch with us also by phone, also when we left the room in a hurry the last day and she was not at home. The room and the bathroom are very clean, the shower is huge and comfortable. The subway is 5 minutes walk away. The building is old, with entrance and wooden stairs in pretty bad condition, but the apartment is cozy inside. We enjoyed our great stay and definitely recommend Kristine!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great space, perfect size for our family of 3, and a whole lot more comfortable than a tiny NYC hotel room for the price! Really in East Williamsburg, so it’s quieter than being in the thick of Williamsburg, but had Subway station at the corner, and close to some great E.Williamsburg restaurants and not a bad walk (or short subway ride) to all Williamsburg has to offer, and of course Manhattan & the rest of NYC as well.

The apartment itself is very spacious for two people, and the decor is quirky and fun.  All very clean, and nice touches like shower gel, shampoo etc.  It was great to have a space to relax in after a busy day sightseeing!  Location was good - there are lots of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk within East Village.  Heidi and Mick were great at communicating - they got back to us really quickly each time, gave us some local recommendations, and were very kind in letting us check in early and check out late - all very much appreciated.  The only downside is that the road outside the apartment is quite noisy at night (although we were there over a long weekend, which may have made it worse), with people walking home from the bars etc.  Not a problem if you sleep well, but if you're a light sleeper like me, then you'd probably want to take earplugs.  However, this wouldn't stop us from staying here again, and we'd highly recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at Carly's place for 2 nights, while on a tight schedule business trip in NYC. But even during  those few hours I actually spend inside the apartment, I really enjoyed it. The apartment, while not big is very tastefully furnished and makes you feel at home. The bedroom is in the back and is very quite, which I'd consider a luxury for Manhattan. The little kitchen has everything you need to get your breakfast or dinner done. The location is great and just two blocks from the Central park, where you can take a nice break from all the hustle and bustle of New York. Tones of great restaurants  and shops in the area. As an experienced traveler and AirBnB user I can also say that the value of this apartment  is exactly right. While searching, I found a lot of places, which looked pretty bad and outdated, while priced at near NYC hotel levels. This is not one of those places, it actually stands for everything I love about AirBnB - you get to stay in a comfortable and  great looking place, understand better the way the locals live, while paying much less than for a night in a 3-star hotel situated in overcrowded touristy areas. This is for me a 5 star travel experience.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Mi esposa y yo nos alojamos 7 noches en el apartamento de Carly.\n491942,45086034,2015-08-31,34577040,Charlotte,\"Carly wasn’t in town for our stay but was helpful with organising our arrival.

It's a very comfy and homely apartment and Carly kindly offered use of her smart TV for our stay.

There is a rehearsal studio near by that gets pretty loud if you are trying to film sound on the roof, yet we were told neighbors complained about our noise at 8pm.  We managed to work around all of it, but I wish that a place advertised for productions would mention these issues before booking, especially since we ended up paying a much higher rental price than what is advertised. I still appreciate their willingness to host productions and large groups, and understand they might have had some bad experiences, just would have loved more flexibility.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Let's start with the essence itself: this place and these hosts are unbeatable!\n495249,19292413,2014-09-09,20311804,Alex,\"From the moment we stepped into the beautiful house my friend and I felt extremely welcomed. The whole house was exceptionally clean. Our room looked exactly like the pictures which we were pleased about but it had a few personal touches.  In the room was a stack of Menu's from local restaurants (these came in handy for morning breakfast!).  The owners also left a NYC Subway Map which they had personalized with spots we should visit around the city (it was our lifeline the whole trip… We also visited several of the highlighted spots).  We were also provided with a nice chilled large glass bottle of water with two glasses. They refilled this bottled constantly throughout our stay.  I have a bad back and the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. I actually slept better than at my own home!  During the night the house and neighborhood was very quiet.  We never heard a thing.

My girlfriend and I looked at every single one and didn't know if the bad ones were a red flag or not. First, the hosts were lovely people did not give us any trouble. The location was okay. Is in fact very close to the subway, less than 5 minute walk,  but it's sketchy at night. It felt unsafe, there were cat callers. When we slept at night we heard domestic disputes and there were a few sirens per night. The bathroom and bedroom looked like someone tried to clean it but they were in no way pristine. I found 2 varieties of cockroaches in the entire apartment, the small beige kind AND the big black kind. I have pictures and videos to prove it. The bed was nice and comfortable. There was sufficienty privacy, and because there are 2 other AirBNB guests in the house, it felt more like a motel than sharing a place with a host, which I felt was a plus. Overall it was a decent place to sleep for the night. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I would if I needed to be in the area. If it's on the lower end of your price range and you aren't horrified of cockroaches it's a fine budget place. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Its location is good, you can go everywhere by subway.

There were roaches crawling on the furniture also. The location is very trashy. The bathroom sink was not wiped down and it had a bad oder.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This UWS apartment was such a nice way to experience real NYC. The stairs are a bit of trouble with heavy suitcases, but if you're travelling lightly then it isn't so bad. Can be a little noisy when the neighbours above plod around their apartment, but adaptable. The door to the apartment building was a little tricky, I was never able to get it to turn, but my sister was able to. Very close to everything. Nice place for base camp! Margaret was also very kind - I had stupidly timed our dates wrong and she gave us suggestions for where else we could stay for the night until our booking. Also was nice enough to push check out a little later for our flights. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My mother and I stayed at Margaret's place for 5 nights 6 days. There was a minor hiccup during the key pick-up when we arrived, but that was out of Margaret's control, and she was quick to respond and help resolve the issue. My suggestion for any future travelers is to check if the key is in the envelope given by the doorman before you get in to the car and leave to the apt. When we arrived, it was as described. There are 3 flights of stairs that are narrows and steep, but it was not too bad for me. However, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is much older. I LOVED the location of the apartment and how close it was to central park as well as the subway. The bed was very comfortable, there were takeout and delivery menus, as well as a comprehensive description of the neighborhood. One thing to note, there was some construction upstairs causing some debris to fall through the vent  above the bathtub, but that was again out of Margaret's control. Furthermore, the bedroom window seems to be stuck and can't be opened, so it might get a tad stuffy in the bedroom. However, there is AC available in the livingroom, so during a warm summer evening you can get cooled down with the windows closed. The kitchen is a tad small, BUT you're in new york, so why cook when you can get some delicious food around the neighborhood or order delivery food based on some of the menus provided! Margaret was quick to respond on all questions, and she was awesome about communication. I am planning to come back to New York again next year, and I will most likely stay in this location again. This apartment will give you a classic New York experience. Thank you for a wonderful stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Staying with Rick was easy, comfortable and nice.

In terms of bringing a family of five to NYC for a few days of holiday fun, it’s hard to do better for the price. We had plenty of space to spread out and relax with our friends, two very nice bathrooms, and a well-equipped kitchen. And the place was spotless when we arrived.

Lägenheten känns nyrenoverad och fräsch men ligger dessvärre i en källare. Takhöjden i badrummet hade vi blivit varnade för men är onekligen ett problem när man som jag är 180 cm lång. I beskrivningen står det att området är mysigt och att det finns mycket att upptäcka, jag vet inte riktigt om jag kan skriva under på det. Säkerligen finns det mer än vad vi tog oss tid att se men tyvärr kändes det som om man var väldigt långt borta från de mer intressanta delarna av Manhattan. Varje gång man skulle ta en taxi så fick man ett höjt ögonbryn från chaufförerna som nog inte är vana vid att turister bor så högt upp på Manhattan. Om man som vi är två vänner som reser så lämnar sovplatserna en del övrigt att önska. Den enda sängen som finns är för smal för två personer (som inte är väldigt kära i varandra) och den tredje sängplatsen är en soffa, som inte var uppbäddad när vi kom. \n518960,27973838,2015-03-15,5454593,Elizabeth,\"The listing description is totally accurate!

Søde værter og hurtige svar. Hyggelig lejlighed, især pejsen og badekar, her om vinteren. Tæt på metro og indkøbsmuligheder af mad og drikke. Kan klart anbefales, hvis man vil bo lidt væk fra travheden i centrum.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>What a great experience!  Janina and Cesar were such sweet and gracious hosts, treated me like family. Very accommodating! The only bad part was that I could not stay longer!  Would not hesitate to come and stay here again. A+ thank you!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Janina is a very nice person, very helpful and always giving you tips of things to do around the area. She helped me since day one when i was booking my trip to NYC and also help me accommodate a day before my stay because (I personally gave her the wrong information of the date when i was arriving to her house). The house is very clean, organize and with lovely amenities. It is located in the heart of Sunnyside Queens, Ny and it is very easy to take the trains to the city. It is very close from the house and only blocks away from any kind of transportation. The main street is also blocks away from the house were you can find plenty different restaurants, bars, and other stores. Very good location to stay if you are planning on being in the city all the time at a good budget.\n519310,133284863,2017-02-21,114619670,Marjorie Ann,The room is great! We really enjoyed our stay.

It would be challenging to make it to the 4th floor if you have larger suitcase as the stair is very narrow ( feeling almost unsafe) and no elevator. And it would be challenging fitting into the rooms as well. The location is not bad with bus line right outside and about 8 mins walk to the closes subway station. Nice restaurant around and also supermarket. Leigh is a nice host that when we arrive at her work place to pick up the key</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I could not have asked for a better place to stay in NYC. The subway is actually not a bad walk and I really appreciate the number of wonderful places to eat and to stop into. If you are willing to try a new area and explore a bit, it’s really a wonderful hidden gem</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Chris is totally a professional. His experiences helps his guests feel comfortable. The house was really clean just like the way it is in the pictures. We had worries about the location but transportation was really easy and the fact that the house was so close to the subway station proved us wrong. It is possible to eat and do shopping from the market untill late hours at night. As a family with 4 members we were really comfortable the whole vacation. We highly recommend this house. Thank you for everything Chris.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>NEGATIVE Feedback.   I did not expect to experience this situation  from an Airbnb listing whose slogan is : “It’s trust that makes it work “ . After a few days , I started feeling very uncomfortable at the host’s apartment. The host showed a very anxious behavior related to  - what she called suspicious behavior of her upstairs neighbor. Actions like peeking through  the hole of the door, unplugging electrical wires etc etc  became daily. I suggested she had the situation investigated, for her own sake and as a safety concern for her paying guests. She didn’t do so, but confronted me instead. Not  feeling safe in her place anymore , I decided to leave a week earlier and asked  –by principle and for the money too - for a partial refund, which I received thru Airbnb. The cleanliness of the room is very questionable too – there is a lack of freshness in the whole apartment and I had to open my window all the time because of a bad odor. The carpet was very old and certainly has not been deep cleaned or received a bacterial treatment for a long time. Maybe this is what caused me coughing so much .The apartment is described as a “2 bedroom” at the website which attracted me , but in reality the host sleeps in a corner of the living room , separated by a foldable screen – which is not very pleasant either….</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>What a lovely experience. Was like an old friend had picked us up to show us their island. Got to see the sights in our air conditioned SUV while Mun shared her local knowledge and led us to the best spots. She went out of her way to make sure we had the best time and we felt well looked after while our plan was completely flexible. If you are looking for something better then a big commercial tour and would like to meet a new friend then you can't go wrong with this experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location Is good, just 3 mins walk to the subway. The communication is good. Gita accepted our request to check in early. The cleaning is bad.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This was my first time using airbnb and it was a wonderful experience. Very smooth check in and out despite me showing up late on the night of check in. Got the keys and Michael showed me everything. Laundry was easy I did it twice during my stay no problems. Great location. This being my first time in NY I had no clue of the city's layout at all but was pleasantly surprised to find that damn near everything I wanted to do was within walking distance. This apartment was coincidentally located very close to my girlfriend's work so extra points for that. For 12 days I didn't run out of things to do in the area, I even walked to the 9/11 memorial which was far but not bad at all. Train stations nearby for when I did use it to go to Queens and Brooklyn. Phenomenal bagel and donut spots nearby such as Brooklyn Bagel, Murrays bagels, Donut Plant, and Dough. Bed was massive, it's the size of some rooms I've lived in lol. Complimentary K cups for the keurig, thank you used them all. Careful using the sink the hot water is super hot so make sure to mix lol learned that within 30 mins of checking in. Overall wonderful stay, hope my future airbnb ventures goes like this one. Thanks Michael.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything is great about this place except for the noise.  I left a day early as I could not endure another evening of hearing either the upstairs neighbour's blaring TV, the hallway conversations and/or the water pipes.  Too bad, Michael is very nice and accommodating and had more than the usual amenities available.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stop your search: this home is what you want. Michael’s place is amazing. We are still so in love with our home away from home and we can’t believe how lucky we are to have stayed here. Michael is a phenomenal host. He is a great communicator and he was very accommodating to our ever-changing departure schedule due to delayed flights. He made sure we were happy and had everything we needed, and gave us great recommendations for exploring Chelsea. The five nights we stayed here were fantastic. The whole apartment was very clean, the bed is SO comfortable with tons of pillows, the couch is huge and cozy, the bathroom is enormous for NYC, the shower’s water pressure is a dream, the apartment layout makes it feel huge, the desk and open space made it easy to get some work done while on vacation, we had plenty of room for all our luggage, the windows offer a ton of natural light, and the shades easily hide it all if you want to sleep in. The apartment is stocked with soft towels, wash rags, plenty of toilet paper and paper towels, a hair dryer, iron, ironing board, and a Keurig that we totally forgot to use. It had more than everything we needed and made our stay so easy. It’s a first floor apartment and has windows on two sides of the building’s exterior walls, offering great views of climbing fire escapes, while not having any windows looking straight into the apartment. The walls are thin but we spent a lot of time in the apartment due to some bad weather, and we barely noticed the sounds of the neighbors at all. The building is clean and safe, the neighbors are kind, and the neighborhood is one of the best in the city. This is my favorite home I’ve ever stayed in and I sincerely hope we can stay here again one day. Thanks for everything, Michael!!!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great apartment, you can't go wrong with David's place. The apartment is beautiful and super comfortable my only regret is that I could not stay longer.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>The unit was beautiful. Newer couch that was very cozy and beautiful. Michelle was quick to respond to all of our questions quickly and kindly. Very detailed instructions so we didn’t get confused on the check on, location, and check out. Close access to the subway. We loved this unit and would happily go back anytime. You can’t go wrong with this property!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Loved this place! Super convenient to public transportation, parking wasn’t as bad as expected, and Michelle was so responsive and helpful! Was enough space for our group of 7, would definitely stay here again!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This is a very spacious bedroom in Greenwich. I felt welcomed during my stay, and the host was nice, quiet and polite. I arrived at the apt late due to taking wrong train and low phone battery, but F.F. welcomed me warmly. I really enjoyed this bnb experience.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is great but the bed was terrible. Very thin and old mattress which deserves to be changed. Bedding is very important. I slept very badly, which impacted on my stay in NYC.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Linda, the host, was extremely helpful and got in touch with me two days before my arrival to inform me about the directions and how to get into the house. She offered to hold my bags before and after the stay if needed and also provided me with ironing board and iron for my clothes. The location is not bad depending on what your travel plans are. Her directions to get to the house were tremendously helpful and the subway and buses to get to the house have a right frequency from the central city. On arrival, I was greeted by her pet cat which was very friendly. The room was clean just a bit smaller than I thought but nothing of a big issue. Had windows all around in the room. The bathroom is on the second floor and is shared with other House members it was clean and stocked with towels and toiletries for guests. Even though the room is next to the main entrance, it was not noisy during the day or night. The house has the bus stop just down the lane to go to the metro station and has a nearby cafe room which opens at 7 am and has a variety of good breakfast options.  Linda was lovely to talk with and helpful. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a pleasant stay in Flushing. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Deze BnB is relatief dichtbij de paarse metrolijn. Het gebruik van een code als sleutel is handig. Ligt in de Aziatische wijk Flushing, veel minder hoogbouw, maar op straat nog steeds erg vol. Dat was geen probleem. Wat vervelender was waren de twee katten met niesziekte die door het huis liepen en ook op de kamer en badkamer kwamen als je ze niet weg joeg. Als je allergisch bent voor katten is dit een slechte optie. Al met al een goede plek en Linda is vriendelijk!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Gorgeous apartment. Very comfortable environment. The host was lovely, and very accomodating. He was very responsive, and very helpul in providing knowledge of the area and how to get around. I would recommend staying in this apartment to anyone who does not mind using the subway to travel into Manhattan. It takes about 20/30 mins to get into Manhattan, which is not that bad, considering how nice and cheap the apartment is. There was plenty of room for 4 of us. I would certainly recommend this to a friend.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I enjoyed my stay with Maurice! He was very welcoming once we got there, and helped us all with our bags. He's very informative and lenient. So if you're looking to have a good time in the city, this the perfect place to stay. Or even if you just wanna lay back & unwind there's an awesome jacuzzi to enjoy as well! I stayed there for the weekend of my 21st... We were kind of iffy with us knowing how loud we are, especially while getting ready to get the night started.. But we were completely wrong. As we got to know him more he seemed to be really cool. Even supplied us a set of speakers, and told us to enjoy our weekend! If you ever need help getting around the city, or just need some extras sheets or towels, he's only a phone call away! I know for a fact we're coming back soon! ... You won't regret this stay :) </td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Check with Maurice in private massege the real address right away when finish the reservation. I couldnt find it in the mails I got confirming the reservation. The only address is the reference address that appears before booking. Probably there is a Folder inside the app that is not of my knowledge but I couldnt find it before traveling. So from the Airport arriving to NY, I was heading to a wrong address at a different neighborhood, till I ask Maurice with a personal massage.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jennie was great - responsive, friendly and helpful. And her place is really cozy, clean, quiet and perfectly located. You can't go wrong staying here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Perfect, it couldn't be better. Tangier is a very nice person and really receptive. The place is very beautifull and spacious, exactly like in pictures and I felt very comfortable all the nine days that I stayed there. The neighbourhood is good, near the metro station, there is a great supermarket and a Starbucks just across the avenue. At next blocks there is a big drugstore/convenience and a great tavern, very well frequented, night and day. Everything was good, nothing bad!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Tangier was a great host, my flight in got delayed by 15hrs which resulted in me ariving at tangiers place at 4am in the morning instead of 6pm the previous day, Even though tangier had to wake up to let me in she was very understanding and courteous, which made me feel less bad about the delay.\n557213,93614241,2016-08-13,41118662,Gina,Everything about my experience with Tangier's place was authentic.

The interior of the apartment smelled of marijuana from heavy, daily use inside the apartment.   :(  The pictures of the room and apartment are outdated--the room now contains a large Queen bed, little floor space and no desk.   The whole reason I booked this place was the desk and floor space for yoga.  I would have used the dining room table but the marijuana smell was really bad.  The bedroom does not smell as bad if you keep the door closed and the window open.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Tangier was a very convenient host, she did everything to make my stay here great, the place was really clean and there’s nothing bad to say about the appartment, everything you need is there, it’s really as if you were at home. Well located in harlem you’ll find many stores and deli market around, moreover you’re at less than ten minuts walk of the north of central park and less than 2 minuts walk of a subway station that will get you in downtown, even in brooklyn without changing line! I highly recommand!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Cuando llegamos el sábado por la noche, la primera impresión del apartamento no fue la esperada pues no había pasado el servicio de limpieza y no estaba suficientemente limpio. Tuvimos que cambiar las sábanas a medianoche antes de meternos en la cama, cosa que no apetece cuando llegas cansado. Por otra parte, cuando se lo comunicamos a Jessica la mañana siguiente, en seguida envió a una chica para limpiar ese mismo día y al regresar por la noche todo estaba mejor. También echamos en falta un poco más de espacio para dejar nuestras cosas, sobretodo en el baño ya que es pequeño. Respecto al vecindario, es un barrio tranquilo con todo lo necesario y con dos paradas de metro cercanas, a 10 o 20 minutos andando.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Die Wohnung von Vana ist ein Traum. 2 Schlafzimmer und ein großes Wohnzimmer mit gut ausgestatteter Küche.

However, aside from all that, the room although is pretty true to picture, the overall apartment may seem a little more disheveled. The sheets weren't the cleanest as well. Monet is a sweet hostess, but  I'm not sure if her husband is completely on board for Airbnb. For the price it's not bad, especially if you're just looking for a place to lay your head. Fort Greene is a great neighborhood.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Everything was OK. The noise from the street wasn't that bad that we expected.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"When we first arrived,  Sajjad and his girlfriend  welcomed  us, showed us around the apartment,  explain local routes to the train station, and what was around the neighborhood. I recommend going to the grocery  store on Marcus Garvey and fulton st.  because it was way cheaper than the delis on every corner  and a lot more options  if you are going to be cooking.  The closest subway(A,C) was about 10 minutes walk  but busses run right around the corner as well. We were able to go all over new york including Manhattan(30 mins), China town, coney island, etc. I recommend bringing an empty  backpack  to take with you especially if you are going to be walking a lot, it easy  to put stuff in the backpack rather than trying to carry everything  on the train. The neighborhood  wasn't too bad, we had a few unkind encounters but it's better to just ignore and keep walking. \n566911,28929672,2015-04-01,7977258,Yzza,\"Sajjad Musa was a very good host</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Muy bien situado en zona con mucho ambiente, metro muy cerca.

Relacion calidad precio excelente, aconsejable si no se esperan lujos.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Very nice and unique space in NYC.  Seith was great... I had trouble with the locks and he was there in less than 10 minutes to help.  Turns out my trouble was that I was trying to unlock the wrong door!  Totally my fault and Seith was very nice about it.  Would totally stay again</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The property was adequate but we didn't feel the property description was accurate or good value for the money paid, based on other accommodation we researched in the area when we were there. The photos were very flattering and did not really reflect what it looked like.  It was much smaller than expected. You have to walk up 2 very, very steep sets of stairs to access the apartment.  very steep stairs. I am 60 and have a bad arm so could not have managed to get my suitcase up the stairs had my son not been there. Also, it is in the middle of lots of bars and restaurants which stay open until late so you have noisy punters yelling and laughing into the early hours of the morning. Large trucks also drive down the road at all hours of the day and night - including the rubbish trucks. I suggest the host installs double glazing which would make a big difference. Signs told you to always lock the doors but the main door out onto the street could not be closed properly therefore could not be locked.  The TV didn't function even though advertised on the website under Amenities. Two of the three heaters provided didn't work. I contacted the host and asked him to ring my son's cellphone to discuss the fact that we had no hot water and to talk about other issues. He didn't ring, instead posting a very brief message on AirBnb. I didn't check this as I had asked him to phone. He had given me his phone number so I wasn't expecting a message in response on AirBnb.  Thanks, Linda</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We stayed in the two bedroom, one bath space. The location in the East Village was ideal. That was pretty much the only positive of this space. Lets start with the three keys. You will be told you have three keys: the first key is for the outside gate, which we did not need, because we could not get it to work, so reached over and very easily turned the knob. Then you enter an unlocked, broken door, climb a very steep set of steps, unlock a second door, climb another set of steps, enter a tiny kitchen(shared by other guests), climb a third set of steps, and unlock your door. It was nearly impossible to navigate luggage up these steps. The kitchen space is dismal: it is flanked by a tiny shower and then a tiny bathroom and then a bedroom (this is the one room suite advertised by seith/keith). If they are in the shower, and you are in the kitchen, well, too bad, privacy goes out the window! While we were there, the other guests were cooking really stinky meals: we could not take it. The smells went right to our rooms. In our suite, the furnishings were straight out of a college dorm room. The tv did not work, the fridge buzzed constantly, the bed in the main room sagged and was extremely uncomfortable. This listing is above a bar,, and people were out till 2:00 every night we were there. You are also right around the corner from a police or fire station: the emergency vehicles are constant. Also, when I called the host three days before arrival, she seemed caught off guard, like she was unaware of our arrival. When I asked if she was Seith, she said yes, but I also see listings for Keith. When I called about the gate lock not working, she/he did not respond until I got a text the next day. And finally, the rooms were advertised for one price, but at checkout, I was charged another, and was told AFTER THE FACT, that the higher bill was for the holiday pricing, which was not clearly identified. All in all, it just was not a good experience. We would never use this space again.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We loved staying here. The place is spacious and very clean. The pictures are very accurate. I was a little bummed the neighborhood didn't have many close bars or restaurants, but is wasn't a bad hike to get to some good areas. All in all would definitely stay again. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td> The place was nice very close to transit everything inside is as described grocery stores and places to eat right around the corner I never made my way over to downtown Brooklyn so I don't know how far it is but the train ride to Manhattan isn't bad I would suggest you stay here it's a good place</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Airbnb Noémie speciaal uitgezocht op de voorzieningen en de tuin. De tuin is echt een pré. Lekker ontbijten of een pilsje drinken na een lange dag zwerven door NYC. De buurt kan bij een eerste indruk onveilig lijken, maar is dit in het geheel niet. Wij hebben tot in de avond van de metro naar huis gelopen en ons op geen enkele wijze onveilig gevoeld. De woning ligt in een upcoming wijk. Vaak werd er vriendelijk gedag gezegd. Twee metro stations zijn op loopafstand (Kingston Throop en Kingston Av). Er rijden ook bussen B43 en B25 naar metrostations. Wasmachine en droger werkten prima. De keuken zou wat meer bestek en servies moeten hebben. Afwasmachine, oven, afzuigkap, gasfornuis en magnetron werkten goed. De keuken heeft een bar. Wij hadden liever een eettafel gehad in de woonkamer. Badkamer met lage instap in bad t.b.v. douche was ook één van onze selectiecriteria. Liever een gewone douche. Maar dat is moeilijk in de USA. Prima verblijf met veel ruimte tegen een acceptabele prijs.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This place was great! It slept 4 very comfortably. Our group came to explore Manhattan for the most part. About a 12-15 min walk to the train on Kingston Ave. (Not a bad walk. If you haven’t been to NYC you will be doing. TON of walking). I would describe the neighborhood as urban and there are convent stores/deli located only a few steps away. Noemie was very helpful and allowed us to park in the drive way during the street sweeping time (Tues/Friday 8:30am-10am). Overall, we all enjoyed our stay & it really gave us an impression on how it feels to live in Brooklyn.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"An incredible rental in an equally amazing location. If you're looking for swank (but very reasonably priced) accommodations in Williamsburg you really can't go wrong here. Your own bathroom, your own floor, AND a patio?! You're thinking \"\"no way!\"\" but I'm here to tell you that it's very much a \"\"YES!\"\" Do yourself a favor and book this.\"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Katherine is aardig en attent. De slaapkamer en badkamer was boven verwachting. De locatie is top. Wij gaan zeker terug als we weer naar New York gaan.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>I would recommend this place as it was very cosy, however I had issues with the door during the time of check in. I was told this was the first time this particular incident had happened, however I could not get into the apartment building. I gained access through the main door but when taking the loft downstairs, I could not access the main apartment door. The key would unlock the door, however the frame was stuck and I was waiting 30 minutes to try and figure what I was doing wrong. I kept losing signal every few minutes, so I had to go all the way back up and outside to regain in (with all my luggage which was a nuisance). I waited 30 minutes or so for a response and didn’t get one. I ended up having to pay for a hotel for one night due to the host not replying. However this was sorted out by the next morning. Airbnb kindly refunded a portion of the hotel fee and I was contacted by the host and managed to get into the apartment with no more issues. The bathroom was wonderful with the shower being at a great temperature and at full power. The bed was comfortable, although delicate (don’t jump on it or get on it abruptly). There was no bin which was rather annoying, so I had to use a plastic bag and put everything into there. The host was lovely and although she was away, when possible she replied to any issues I had after check in (on my second day). The subway wasn’t too far away with Macy Av a good 12 minute walk or Bedford Av roughly 5 minutes away. There’s a lovely cinema nearby called Williamsburg Cinemas, cheap too!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My only regret about choosing to stay with Mark and Stoph is that I didn't stay longer. The apartment is very nice, and in an interestingly historic building. It is cosy and well-kept, and the bed space is discreet. The views are better than advertised, too, and the hosts are warm, cheerful, helpful and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing or anything bad like that. Overall staying here with these people gave me a pretty much perfect introduction to New York, so if that' s what you want, you can't go wrong here.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The place is very nice, cosy, also only 1 block from subway, which is very good. The entire room was clean at all time. Melanie is such a great host, giving us a warm welcome and even offer us to stay longer because our flight was delayed due to bad weather.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"Experiences in this apartment: We don't recommend this place for several reasons, in the first place the terrible management of the owner, the total lack of cleanliness of the apartment and above all this, her absolute lack of interest in problems caused by her awful management. The price is far above what it's worth. We were forced to pick up the keys in a nearby supermarket at night after a transoceanic flight. They gave us the wrong key and we were in the middle of the streets, with luggage. We had to return to the supermarket to get the right keys. How did we know that nobody could copy the keys and rob our stuff? When we finally got the door open we found that they had left the washing machine on and a note where they told us to \"\"put the dryer on\"\". Between that first night and the next day we saw the serious deficiency of cleaning</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kanan & Tabias' place was in an excellent location for our stay in Brooklyn, though it's on a local train line, which can be a hassle. Billed as modern, it could use updating and a deep cleaning. The linens and towels looked like college castoffs. There was no bath mat in the main bathroom. The floor sloped so badly that my computer slid off the kitchen table and died. Both bathroom doors did not open and close properly. There was no coffee table, no hassock, no end table. The bathroom sink wasn't so tiny it was impossible to wash my face without hitting my head against the shelf above it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The NYC experience;  Coming to this boisterous & exciting  city was quite an adventure and exasperating at the same time because I didn't know what to expect; good or bad experience, being the first time in the USA and also using Air bnb, but to my amazement,  my host  Jeffrey made it easy for me; he welcomed me and quickly eased me into the subway transportation having come from the UK that I think has the best Tube routes!! L</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Jeffrey is a terrific host.  You can't go wrong staying here!!!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Great location and great host.  Can't go wrong.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Hilary was a fantastic host  and assisted with our concerns throughout our stay. Our first night saw a badly blocked toilet after one use. We got in touch with Hilary and she had it all fixed by the time we got home from dinner in the evening. We had no further troubles with the toilet during our stay. The apartment space was clean, tidy and even had room for our suitcases. The air conditioning in the apartment was fantastic! Unfortunately the apartment building allows dogs and a very unhappy dog lives below the apartment and barks constantly throughout the day but more importantly, night. We wore ear plugs but were still kept awake. Hilary offered to speak to the neighbours and even let us borrow a sound machine to assist us with sleeping, which we really appreciated.

However there is a 35 minute ride on the subway to get into midtown. This wasn't that bad because the station is so close to his actual apartment. The building itself smelt a bit off and was not clean, but Chris's apartment itself was quite clean! Which is really all that matters in the end. The sheets and towels were nice and clean. The shower water only got luke warm, but that's better than freezing. Outside the streets are quite noisy so my friend needed ear plugs. But once she had earplugs, she slept much better. I would stay here again, and I think that's what really matters.

The window to the bedroom is right next to the main Street so unless you like the sound of NY traffic at 3AM maybe bring some ear plugs. Also, the room seemed to lack blankets for the blow up mattress, so if you're planning on staying on the separate bed, maybe bring a blanket?

Una genia!!) nuestro espacio de abajo era bastante grande, los lugares importantes (cama, baño y cocina todo súper limpio y cómodo).. la cama es muy cómoda y grande.. el baño incluye un lavadero que se puede utilizar y que a nosotros por estar tanto tiempo nos sirvió!! La bañadera tira gran cantidad de agua y bien caliente ( lo único que si se quieren bañar dos personas seguidas, la segunda se queda sin agua caliente si no se baña rápido pero nos arreglamos bien) La cocina tiene todos los utensilios necesarios para cocinar lo que quieras, ( hasta molidor de café que Lori te deja café incluido, mi novio lo usaba todas las mañanas y andaba perfecto) La locación tiene todo al alcance.. El Barrio es muy lindo con casas típicas y cero peligroso, muy tranquilo de noche y muy activo de día. Tiene el subte de dos cuadras, mercados cafés Walgreens en la esquina, muchas ofertas gastronómicas para todo tipo. Ah! Y nuestro compañero de departamento, John, es muy amable (lo vimos dos veces en toda la estadía) es súper silencio y respetuoso..

I am sorry about the low review as the host was nice but three times i had to kill bugs in the bathroom and there was no way I could have showered in there. There were also bugs all in the kitchen cupboard which was unpleasant to say the least.

Basically you are on your own and have privacy. Room is ok, small but convenient. WiFi is working fine. You can lock your room - it’s good. Masud is polite and nice person. Now about bad things. Lack of cleanness and hygiene. The place is dirty. When I came it seems that last vacuum cleaning was year ago. 2 cats are there and all carpets were in their fur. After 20 days Masud finally did a vacuum cleaning, it started to look almost ok. Bathroom is almost all right instead of tons of a black mould on the ceiling. It is dangerous for health. Now kitchen. Lots of roaches (I mean Lots), dirty, bread crumbs and dirt all over the floor. Again - no cleaning schedule or rules. Not a pleasant place to spend time and cook at all. Uncomfortable. One of two cats used to walk and seat on the dining table, leaving dirty traces because cats also spend time outside (sorry cats I really liked you). From the window you have a view on a backyard - depressive debris. Only one cooking pot for 3 rooms. Someone forgot to clean - problem for you. No detergent provided when finished (guests are expected to buy it themselves I suppose). Bathroom was cleaned by one of the guests, once Masud did it. \n613818,29700512,2015-04-11,27708087,Mike,\"Masud is the best host I've had with Airbnb.

I liked the neighborhood as a area but there was not a single vegetarian restaurant and it was difficult to search for food. Listing was accurate however it should also explain how old the house is which gives fair idea to guest and choose the stay appropriately like a 15 year old is a bad house to stay unless it is refurnished. In this case I felt the same all old equipment in house makes you feel sick living. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Stephen and Carla's apartment was fantastic! The apartment is exactly as pictured and quite large for New York. It was clean and comfortable and Stephen and Carla were very accommodating. Our flight was delayed and they made it very easy for us to collect the keys.  They provided subway maps and city guide books to help us out.  The apartment is in a great area with loads of bars and restaurants only a few streets away and the subway is only a 5 minute walk. The apartment is relatively quiet as it faces a courtyard and not the street. It is an older building, so you can hear your upstairs neighbours at times and the stairs can be a work out with suitcases, but it is only 3 flights up, so not too bad at all.  Everything we needed was in the apartment and we really enjoyed our stay.  We would not hesitate  to book Stephen and Carla's apartment again.  Highly recommended!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My roommate and I decided to move from Florida to New York in August. We needed a place to stay until we could find a more permanent home. Karl and Catherine opened their home to us and they were great hosts!! They live on a beautiful street with classic brownstones, in fact their street is always being used for films! The location of their beautiful home is absolute prime! You can stand on their front steps and hit the 7 train (which is a great line) with a rock. They are a few quick stops outside of Grand Central Station and minutes from midtown Manhattan. The M/E is 2 blocks away and the G to Brooklyn is just a few blocks away as well. They are also just a few short blocks from the happening area of Long Island City and also a large, newly renovated waterfront park. We wanted so badly to stay in the area and we were actually able to find a place pretty close by! The area is very safe, and I still go back all the time because I babysit for a few families in the neighborhood. Karl and Catherine were very helpful and kind to us. They were able to tell us what trains to take when we needed to get somewhere. They were able to suggest great local bars and restaurants to go to, especially a great speakeasy bar just a few blocks away. In fact Karl actually makes GREAT cocktails at the house, and you MUST try one. I also celebrated my birthday during my stay there and they got me some gourmet cupcakes. Although I know it was really hard for Karl to resist from eating them himself, it was a really sweet gesture. Karl and Catherine were especially helpful with advice when looking for an apartment, Karl even spoke to several brokers for us. Staying with them was perfect for our transition to NY, they made us feel right at home! I would definitely stay here again purely because of the location, but the wonderful hospitality was just an added bonus!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Amazing loft, really beautiful and ideal location.

Het fijne van deze B&B is dat je veel privé ruimte hebt: een slaapkamer, een badkamer, een computerkamer en toegang tot een ongelooflijk gezellige kleine tuin. Alles tot in detail smaakvol ingericht. Daarnaast mochten we gebruik maken van hun keuken en koelkast, en ook van hun was-droog combinatie. Het was een paradijsje van rust om bij te komen van de vermoeiende tripjes naar Manhattan. Het bed is heerlijk zacht en voorzien van luxe beddegoed. Hun huis ligt temidden van een hele gezellige levendige en heel veilige buurt, omgeven door winkeltjes, restaurantjes, bars.

Grace is very detailed and a clear communicator, and I really appreciate that because bad hosting experiences usually come from just bad communication.  There are so many perks of staying at Grace's home: it's close to a beautiful park, close to the subway, in a really nice community, and close to many restaurants and bars filled with locals.  You can get downtown very quickly using the A train, and I used it often.  Grace also provides an excellent resource book, maps and guides to help you organize your stay.

For example: the shower must run ~9 minutes to get hot then - Barely enough water pressure to get your hair wet and rinse.

The location is pretty good, about a 15 minute walk to the metro, but if you spent your day walking around NYC it can seem very far. The only problem that we ran into was when we arrived back later that night the router for the internet had been removed from the room we were staying in so there was no wifi. We were going to ask about it but then there was an argument in the apartment and yelling so we did not feel comfortable leaving the room. Being students it was important to have wifi to do homework, and as it was a listed amenity we did not understand why it was removed, especially since it was located within the private room. I would have appreciated being told why an amenity was removed or if there was a problem with it so we could plan accordingly. We were able to leave our bags in the apartment to pick up later, which was very accommodating.

I felt warmth from the very first contact unlike other hosts on this site. I felt confident with the booking after and this was solidified after I was able to FaceTime her a few days before my vacation, when she was also able to give me information on what to expect weather wise and events and time of year and so forth. After this discussion my family felt a lot more comfortable I was going to stay with a \"\"stranger\"\".  The house is located in a very pleasant area. It's quiet and a block away from the sea. I challenge anyone to stay with Natalie and feel anything but welcome! Any question I had was always answered. This was a birthday trip and I found out our birthdays were within a week of each other and Natalie invited me to a beautiful birthday brunch with her friends and family and I was so glad I accepted the invite. In the air bnb television advert the girl said she met strangers and left family. I think they should have shot the advert with Natalie because that is exactly what happens when you stay with her. Ooh and when you stay</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I hate to leave such a negative review, but I am forced to because I'd rather be honest about my experience. For starters Jullett was difficult to reach. I had to text and call her a few times just to get the door code. Here's the good news, the home is a nice home, and the neighborhood isn't bad, it is only one block to the bus. Plus there was a T.V in the room with more channels then I could ever ask for. My problems were the smell in the main area, while not a bad smell, is definitely noticeable. Then, what made my experience horrible was that I was in a bedroom on the first floor, and whoever was above me kept me awake the entire night. The floor creaked, and creaked, I can only imagine what whoever it was up there was doing. I paid to have a place to get some sleep & I didn't get what I paid for.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Our stay with Jullett was Amazing! She's a good kind Godly woman!

Yolanda called us a couple of times to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  There is not one bad thing to say about this place!

Yolanda was very accommodating, though we never met in person, she always responded in a timely manner! As other guest stated there is a welcome book which gives loads of information about nearby food and how to get around. We had a car so the commute into the city was only about a half hour in good traffic, not too bad in my opinion! Though street parking could kinda be a hassle we always found somewhere close to park and we never got a ticket! The neighborhood felt very safe, and very Brooklyn.

The bedrooms are a good size and fit 6 people comfortably. The stairs leading up to the loft are a little steep, so beware if you're coming back from a night out. My friends and I left the apartment by 11am and didn't get back until around midnight during our entire stay, but if you wanted to spend all day at the apartment without leaving, you easily could. Regardless, it's only a few blocks away from a subway stop, and a few blocks away from great coffee shops, markets and bagel stores. If you've never been to New York City or Brooklyn before, you may think its in a bad area, but its completely safe. It's typical for an up-and-coming Brooklyn neighborhood. The bathroom was nice and clean, same with the kitchen. Had plenty of amenities. I accidentally left a handful of items and I got a message from Wray pretty quickly letting me know. A+ host, A+ apartment!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Really great stay in Yve's apartment. Tony the property manager was great at keeping in touch and getting back whenever we had any at all questions. We loved the terrasses.

But for the rest of us it was amazing.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ingrid and her husband we awesome hosts! I didn't get a chance to meet Ingrid but her husband helped us get settled down and helped us with directions and everything we needed!

Nothing bad to say about our stay here!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>My stay with Ingrid was very pleasant. We got to the guestroom very late but she waited for us just to greet us and make us feel comfortable. Neighborhood was not bad and very near train stations. The apt. was very clean and organized.

Lots of great books in the bookcases, you sense that Charlie is learned and accomplished in his field, has lots of great ideas, a major marathoner athlete, but very humble nonetheless. This place is exactly as described: minimalist, clean, convenient -- no surprises. Perhaps I benefitted from a weekend where many were gone, but the street was super quiet (unless you object to birdsong), taxi's easily accessible, and restaurants, shops and famous bakeries ready to greet you at the other end of the block on Columbus.

Roberto was very warm and welcoming and always available if I had a question or concern. The apartment itself is very nice and in a great location in Williamsburg.

Everything was great and the kitchen has just about everything one might need. Highly recommended. My only suggestion for improvement would be a bit of decoration: the walls are all bare white and the furnishings are minimal and minimalistic. If you're a minimalist, this is heaven; if not, like me, you might miss that homey touch as well as a bigger couch, etc. You should know also that the shower and bathroom are really tiny, but that didn't bother me. Would definitely come back to Gisela's.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Marianne is an excellent host, not to mention a sweetheart.  She has a lovely home in a beautiful neighborhood, with all the amenities including a great patio setting.  She is a quick 10 min walk to the SI rail.

You will feel like you're staying with family, but with complete peace and privacy. You will have all the best of the Village and the Lower East Side, new and old, just outside your door. If you value authenticity and idiosyncracy, if you love wonderful old buildings, if you want a reliable host, if you want to be part of the New York that people wish there was still more of, Barry's place is the place for you. We (former New Yorker and complete newcomer) loved it, and can't wait to return.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Alison’s place was very charming and perfect for the 3 of us.

I never actually met him as he was out of town when I was there and arranged for me to get the keys from the store downstairs. He was always very attentive and I appreciated that.  As a former NYC resident I had forgotten how small apartments are so be prepared. It would be very difficult for more than one person to stay there.  The place is in a great neighborhood....surrounded by everything you need. Not a bad walk to the subway. Not a great situation for short people to get ready to go out. The mirrors are placed very high because Jack is apparently very tall. I found the lack of a low hanging mirror for someone my size very inconvenient.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Kevin was an accommodating host, allowing us to check in early and leave our bags in the room. The apartment is in a great location. However if you're looking for a space that has enough room to open up your bags and relax, this is not the place for you. Furthermore, if you're a light sleeper or appreciate sleeping in past 6:30am on holidays, I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere. You can easily hear the loud footsteps of the apartment directly above you. Also please be aware that the loft is directly above the bathroom, so you will be surrounded by the smells that filter up, both good and bad. This was definetly not my favourite experience through Airbnb but this all depends on what you are after.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Ubicación bastante buena. No hemos conocido a Kevin. Limpieza del baño mala. Bastante ruidoso el apartamento. Nuestra habitación era la del altillo, no tiene puerta ni nada, cuando llegaban los otros inquilinos a la casa por la noche y dan la luz del salón se nota y no puedes hacer nada. Como el techo del altillo es bajo, cuando estás tumbado en la cama escuchas todos los pasos y ruidos del piso de encima.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A cool spot to stay!

We quite liked the neighbourhood for the many children and families on the streets (it being the Bronx we had expected it worse). There are two metrolines which bring you straight into Manhatten in about an hour travelling for only a 2,5 dollar fee.

The apartment itself is great - clean, roomy, cool in an understated industrial way, and in an absolutely fantastic neighbourhood - slap bang in the middle of Williamsburg's beating heart, with brilliant bars, restaurants, galleries, vintage stores and the L-train to Manhattan all right on your doorstep. It's a fantastic spot. The location could not have been better.  We particularly loved the shower. The amenities through the rest of the apartment were absolutely fine although there is no stereo/ speakers or TV. This didn't really trouble us as we were out all the time. Great selection of books - fiction and non-fiction and games like Scrabble.  Ian generously told us to take whatever we wanted from the fridge and had left it stocked with a selection of goodies, drinks, cold meats, cheese etc. A nice touch. Roof terrace is basic but has fantastic views over Manhattan. There was a bit of ambient noise from the apartment above at night but nothing too bad but the street cleaners outside do start pretty early in the morning.  Although we didn't meet Ian during our stay (though we would have been happy to see him I think a host who keeps his distance is a very good thing indeed!) he did respond to text messages and very kindly offered to hold on to our luggage for a couple of hours after we had requested a late check-out.

The first impression of the door outside arriving from the airport was very surprising! We thought: \"\"Welcome in NYC!\"\" We walked three floors up to get to the third floor as in Germany we would have done and we realized that it was the fourth. Apparently the Ground Floor is already the first floor!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The Loft is located 2 blocks away from the subway which is crucial if you have been Walking around NYC all day and are tired. The loft is spacious, with 3 bedrooms and one bath which did not pose a problem. Lots of light and ample space for sitting in the living room and a large dinner table. The front door with all the ´garbage in front of it seemed a bit frightening but I explained to my guests that this is typical in New York and will get better once we open the door which it did. New York residences often look bad from the outside but exposed brick and large lofts with lots of sunlight lie behind the front door to surprise and please you. Communication with Ian was easy and pleasing. The only problem was the cleanliness -it looked as if the loft had not been properly cleaned for some time and it was the only thing my guests really complained about. Otherwise the location and loft cant be beat.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>This was the perfect NYC apartment and Arnel and Frank were the perfect hosts!

All the amenities we needed including wireless internet, fully stocked kitchen, comfy bed, great views, and it was so quiet...we hardly heard any street noise!  There were even umbrellas in the closet!  Frank was there to greet us and Arnel stopped by to say hello...and thanks for that delicous pie you brought us, Arnel!!!

The apartment was great for our stay there. We weren't in it much but at night it was nice to come home to. Clean in all aspects!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Franks place was in a lively and great location! Everything you need in the apartment. Just be cautious that there is no elevator, about 4 flights of stairs. The fruit market downstairs has added a very bad smell to the entrance of the apartment though! So partner and I hurried up amd down the stairs to escape the smell. Overall, you're smack bang in a great location.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Frank's place was PERFECT for my mother/daughter trip to NYC.

The place was very clean and Frank made the check in process very easy.  Would definitely stay again!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Frank, the host, was available and incredibly responsive. He took the time to notify us that he had made the apartment ready earlier than expected because of our early arrival to the city. This location is ideal! Perfect for travelers planning to mainly walk and use the subway. Close to tons of restaurants and bars. Short walk to Times Square. The building is a five story walk up which isn’t that bad if you’re in shape but would be a challenge for some. Frank was very forthcoming about warning us about this which was greatly appreciated. He took the time to meet us upon arrival and show us around. Not a lot of space or amenities at the apartment but that didn’t bother us as we were really only there for sleep. We did not use the kitchen for cooking. Overall a good experience. Comfortable, warm and affordable. Frank was great!</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Tauheed is genuine, thoughtful, loyal, and a vibrant host. He will make sure your stay is just like home. This is definitely a good spot.

It was easy to set off and explore the surrounding cafes and shops and call back 'home' when we needed to. The metro (to Manhattan) is also really close. When I booked I was concerned about street noise (light sleeper) but it wasn't bad at all. We could often hear the people above us and around us (who were very heavy footed!!) until the early hours of the morning which was annoying but reflects the age of the building. Sean was great and there to show us around on arrival. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>This has been a trip with lots and lots of hiccups for us...except for the dreamy room and amazing hospitality from Aziza. As a host, she did way more than she should and went out of the way to accommodate us with a lot of situations...and I do mean a lot here, because we ran into problem with almost everything. When so much bad luck came our way during a trip we had saved up money for that takes place on the other side of the world, we could hv been hugely let down. But our experience was really a blessing disguise which allowed us to meet such a wonderful host. The room was exactly described- stylish, comfortable and had EVERYTHING we needed. Bed is normally a main concern for us but Aziza's was so comfortable I would pass out in it instantly after a long day. I look forward to staying Aziza's room again the next time I come to NY (without bringing her trouble like this time) and meanwhile I'd highly recommend her room to all travelers.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>*If you are scrolling past and don’t want to read a long review, then just read this:* DO NOT STAY HERE. It is THE biggest waste of your money and time. I paid for an entire month in this place and it was one of the biggest travel mistakes I’ve ever made. I paid over $5,800 Australian dollars for a tiny space that was barely functional at times, just don’t do it! Don’t be fooled by it being across the road from Magnolia Bakery, this really means nothing! Also New York has an extensive subway system, you could stay in Brooklyn for much cheaper and be anywhere in Manhattan from 15-30 mins. Do not be fooled by the pictures posted, the entire living space that you can actually move or walk in is about 2.5 metres by 1.5 metres. The bed and “couch” (glorified chair) takes up half the living space. I will break this down into the spaces and also the communication and “services” (honestly no real services, have no idea why there is an extra fee for services not provided) as for easier reading. Firstly, I never met Daniel, or the supposed ‘cleaner’ he hired, I only ever met his friend Frank who lived in the apartment building below us. (Honestly, unsure if Daniel exists, maybe Frank is Daniel?) I found this unprofessional as I was staying in his supposed apartment for over a month (which I also found out was not even legal in New York), he also replied bluntly and rudely at times over text when I asked for things I think I was certainly entitled to. On to the topic of this ‘cleaner’, apparently a cleaner named Rita works for Daniel but I never actually saw her, she was also supposed to come weekly, so at least 4 times. She came twice, and one of the times she said she came to the apartment, I returned to the place 30 mins after she said she had left and not one thing was cleaned. Firstly, this was after rescheduling the time AND day of when she could come. She also didn’t leave any extra soap or washing liquid for the dishes, OR washing liquid for the clothes washing machine. Also, this first time, when I messaged her asking to bring some soap for the bathroom sink so I could wash my hands, she brought a body wash soap… I’m sorry but honestly why would that be what was brought? I made it quite clear I just needed a bar soap or liquid hand soap, you know, basic hygiene products. Then I was also sent a passive aggressive text after this visit from Daniel, not Rita, saying to not “drag my suitcase around on the carpet” and “leave marks” everywhere. Although he had no proof of this, I returned home and looked at the carpet which was perfectly clean, the carpet is just one of those ones that if moved against the grain it looks a darker colour, after I smoothed it, it was perfect again. The second time Rita was supposed to come, she cancelled twice and changed days and times, she ended up coming a full week after she was supposed to and so the apartment hadn’t been ‘cleaned’ in almost 3 weeks (so much for weekly cleaner). I had messaged Daniel to ask him to ask Rita to bring some washing liquid for the clothes machine, to which he replied “it’s not her job” after this condescending and frankly rude response, he also added he would order me some online. When I returned home, there were 5 washing capsules sealed in a plastic ziplock bag – actually unsure who left this in the kitchen, was it Rita? Was it Frank? Was it Daniel? He never actually told me how many people had keys to the apartment which did not make me feel very secure or safe honestly. Anyway, clearly he had not ‘bought it online’ as he said he would, and just got spares from himself or someone else. So not only was the passive aggressive comment and response not needed, he also continued to save himself a couple dollars. All in all, his communication was abrasive, rude, condescending, and at times sporadic, which I think is ridiculous if you’re going to ask someone to pay almost $6000 for a crappy, tiny apartment. Bed: The bed is also ridiculously squeaky, you will notice this even if you’re not a light sleeper, I would sit down or turn from my side to my back and it squeaks like no tomorrow. There was no proper light in the living room/bedroom just 1 big lamp and one small lamp. Bathroom: the sink had no soap holder, so I awkwardly had to try and find places to leave it, the shower is very odd. There is a wooden coffin thing that I think is supposed to be a bathtub under the shower, but it’s honestly just scary, ineffective, uncomfortable and splintery. The fan barely works so good luck if you want to have a warm shower. Also the DOOR, the door to the bathroom is an extremely heavy block that you have to pull with a latch, it slams closed and actually once slammed onto my hand, the back of my hand was bruised after that for 5 days. Dangerous!!! The air conditioner is barely effective, also extremely loud so again, good luck if you want to sleep and not be boiling hot. Kitchen: Okay so Daniel does not have an oven. Or a toaster. Or a kettle. Yes, like normal things that normal people have in their kitchen NORMALLY. Trying to use the ‘kitchen’ – if you can even call it that, it was exactly 3 small benchtops long – felt like I was in an incredibly badly designed game, the water from the spout sprayed everywhere every time it’s turned on. The stovetop is tiny and I burnt my hand just trying to move a pot...</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Not bad. And quite cozy and clean place. But too noizy. </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>The space is a little worse than I expected. The entire apartment was dusty, the lamps barely worked. It got extremely hot at night.

It was loud - perhaps also an airbnb.  It was my second stay here, first with my husband. The bed is a bit soft for two and dips in the middle. Lighting also far too dim.

I will stay here again next trip.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>First Airbnb ever! And what a great experience. Our room was really clean and wonderful. I’ve stayed in some nice hotels in my life and haven’t missed that one bit! Despite warnings of ‘city noises’ we really didn’t notice much at night. The C train 155 station on the subway is super close, and the A train on 157 street is also really just a couple of minutes (round the corner, two blocks) which can be handy if you don’t feel like changing much to get to some places. As for the host, there is nothing bad I can say about Michele, she is very responsive, makes sure you get there ok, and her explanation for options to getting to her place is very detailed. Staying with her is really easy, she’ll respect your privacy and just lets you get on with you day. But if you need anything she as always ready to answer any question you might have! If I could give a six star rating I would :)</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Unfortunately my experience was not good here. The good thing is that the place is close from the R and M subways that take you to Manhattan in 30 mins, and that it is quite close to LGA. Now bad there was plenty. I never got to meet the host, and when I first went in the guests from the other room were very upset because there were roaches in the kitchen. I know some people are ok with this and an occasional roach might be unavoidable in New York, but this was an infestation. Tons of very small and medium roaches, which I also occasionally saw in the bathroom and my own room. The other guests ( who made videos of the roaches also) left, I didn't want to deal with the hassle of moving with my bags to a new room just for a couple of days of stay so I stayed. When I complained to the hosts they said \"\"their aunt\"\" would take care of it. Probably someone came to clean one day but to get rid of this amount of roaches some cleaning won't do. The rooms were also very small. I also never heard back from the hosts after the \"\" aunt\"\" message. \"</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I stayed for a brief 4 weeks in Jesse and Veronika's and I feel so bad that i hadn't stayed longer. \n812467,13177547,2014-05-21,12539532,Isaiah,\"Jesse was a fantastic host</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Christine is a fantastic host, well more of a friend if you will.

Luckily, Jason's place was a great find! His apartment was the perfect size for my long weekend, clean and stylish (the photos are accurate) - and is of course centrally located to tons of stuff.  The air-conditioning was powerful (which always helps in NYC in the summer); the bath products were fancy; and the treetop and greenery views out of the windows were charming. I also appreciated Jason's flexibility with my arrival and departure.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The apartment was good and had everything you needed. I would personally stay closer to manhatten next time however it was only a 15 minute tube journey into the centre with trains through the night which wasn't all that bad! Not everyone would want Internet,  however we struggled to use the Internet as it was shared with her house upstairs so cut off a lot. Good apartment otherwise!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Jennifer was very accommodating with check-in times and allowing us to leave our luggage so we could explore on our last day in NYC. Her flexibility was very much appreciated. The guest house is large and spacious. It does appear true to the photos. There is a school across the street, which makes the location noisy early in the morning on weekdays. If you are a morning person or plan to get up early for sight-seeing, then this will not effect you. The space was tidy, but someone OCD about cleanliness (like me) may find a few faults. Overall, good experience for the price in NYC and not a bad location (minus the noise). Within walking distance to Central Park and subway.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>\"In all honesty I was disappointed with the place. Don't get me wrong it was \"\"fine\"\" but there were some issues; cleanliness of the floors</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>the host is very welcoming and friendly. the home however is older than the photos show and the bathroom is in a bad quality.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Aletia & her roommates were very welcoming. I felt right at home. The only downside was a really uncomfortable twin size bed: the mattress topper smelled funky and offered no support. The bed made squeaky noises and could use an upgrade.

We werden zeer hartelijk ontvangen, met een kopje koffie en kregen veel uitleg en tips over de omgeving en wat er allemaal te beleven viel. De kamer en de badkamer waren zeer proper.

Arthur en Ed zelf zijn zeer lieve, aangename mensen, heel erg gastvrij. Kortom, een echte aanrader!! Bedankt, Arthur en Ed, voor alles wat jullie voor ons gedaan hebben!! We hebben het heel erg geapprecieerd! Miet en Inge</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>To future quests: if you have come as far as reading this review, just book the place. If the things that you read in their own description is what you are looking for, then you cannot go wrong in booking this place. These guys know how to treat guests, but are discrete when needed. The location is very central, provided that you want to cover the whole area from Central Park all the way to the Financial District, incl. good public transport options that are available at the doorstep. The beds are very comfortable (as long as you do not mind sleeping apart) and there is no New York noise that disturbs you at night, due to the fact that the bedrooms face the highline (which is closed at nighttime).</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Great place to stay in NYC! My mom and I were exhausted both nights we stayed there and it was nice to come back to a cute apartment with a comfy bed. It was nice to have an AC in the room with blackout curtains that blocked out the street light. You can still hear street noise but it’s not bad at all. Anja was super sweet and welcoming and made it super easy for us to check in and she was quick to respond.  Little Italy and Chinatown are walking distance away and Subway is close by as well. Def recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Dante as a host is a good one, he is nice, but sadly my luck was not that good, sadly Dante was traveling and the people before i came in to the room, were not very clean, and his cleaning lady bailed on him, but Dante gave me a partial reimbursement. so A+ for that. he explained to me that it is really my bad luck that the house was like that. still recommend him.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"The unit was as described. \n825486,162840064,2017-06-22,287689,Jocelyn,Fantastic host and location.

Towels and bedding didn't seem fresh. Trifle, but we had to buy our own toilet paper (there was only one roll in stock for 4 people for 4 days). The couch is in very bad condition - very loud during every move and it's surface crumbles in hundreds small, white pieces. The iron is broken and has a big whole in the middle - using such equipment is extremely dangerous. Generally, there are many decorative things which are completely unnecessary and instead of this the needed things are in bad condition and need replacement (even cheap stuff from ikea would be good). To sum up - great location, good accommodation and host, but some equipment and furnishing have to be replaced.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I am frequent patron of Airbnb and also a homeowner of a house on (Hidden by Airbnb) , so I feel fairly confident in my rental expertise in submitting this review.\n825486,229792771,2018-01-25,162830676,Med,one the best trips and I highly recommend\n825486,230017843,2018-01-26,121380801,Luna,Great place!

With the G line stopping right around the corner, getting around was a breeze, and Casey's reccomendations were spot on: breakfast, coffee, cocktails-he didn't steer us wrong with anything! </td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>We were upset to see that the flat was not properly cleaned: there was hair on the floor in the living room and bathroom, the bath-tub looked dirty & old, bedsheets/ 1 pillow-case had some dirty old spots as well, 1 out of 2 towels given to us looked very used and unpleasant (even being washed). One side of the mattress was probably in worser condition then the other one, coz my friend was slipping down from the bed, so we had to change sides, as I am lighter & smaller in size. For me it felt better, but still we had to sleep closer to the middle of the bed, coz the mattress definitely needs to be changed. Upon our complaints, Katherine advised us to relax & enjoy the city, which we for sure did, but still would prefer to live in a better & cleaner flat. But later Katherine was kind enough to send us new towels & offered to check for spare bedsheets in the drawer - that we did, but still found dirty old spots & hair on them & decided not to use.  Overall our impression of the flat is way below average, mostly because of the flat not being ready to be lived in. So if you care about staying in a clean & tidy place I would not recommend you this one.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Fiona's apartment is in the best neighborhood in NYC. It's truly a charming area with everything you need close by. We enjoyed a great variety of restaurants, shops and so many friendly people. There is quick access to subways, buses and taxis. Make no mistake, this is an old apartment in need of some new paint and it has a very creaky old wood floor. It also badly needs a smoke alarm. But the shower is good and the kitchen works fine if you choose to eat in, which we never did--too many great restaurants nearby. Our stay happened during an unseasonably hot and HUMID week in October so the bedroom never really cooled off.

Husband is from Brooklyn so we weren't lost by any means but thankful our host checked in on us!  Plan on an hour +/- from LaGuardia but the location can't be beat.  The Q train takes you just a 10 minute walk to their home.  The location is a quick ride to Coney and a bit longer into the city but well worth it.  The neighborhood is excellent.  We spent a bit too much time visiting friends one night then stopped at Katz's (MUST go if near) for a middle of the night nosh.  Even though we got in very late I felt very safe walking from the train through the area.  And we even got off at the wrong stop due to talking and not paying attention so we walked for an hour.

The shower had black mold/hair in the drain and the bathroom hand soap was 95% water.

Worst of all: Our bedroom door didn’t have a lock on it, so the other Airbnb guests that roam the house could have easily gotten into our stuff.  Nothing got stolen, it’s just a bad set up.

Check in was a bliss and every little detail about finding the room and the amenities was explained in detail. The pictures are very true to what the room looks like so there are no surprises. The room is so nice and I love that she has a wardrobe with hangers and a little hanging shelf where you can use to put your clothes away. While I was there the night got a little colder than I expected and Christina (the amazing host that she is) has extra blankets there that definitely keep you warm throughout the night. It was also such a blessing that Christina included the metro card! As soon as I got to my room the metro card was waiting for me on the desk and the next day I took full advantage of that bad boy! Christina definitely puts some thought into hosting her home and she makes herself available if you have any questions and will respond in a matter of minutes.

She was very helpful when we got there and we called to figure out how to get to her house on the subway from downtown and even picked us up from the subway station. She leaves directions on which buses to use to get from her house to/from the subway and ideas of where to go in NYC. The place is convenient to get to public transportation and the metrocards she threw in for our week stay were priceless! The room is very nice with a huge tv, a nice chaise and futon, a nice bathroom, nice kitchenette area with cabinets, sink, small fridge, and microwave and she even has it stocked with a few snacks and coffeemaker. The room has a separate entrance so you don't disturb anyone if you come in (Website hidden by Airbnb) in the basement so you do hear people walking around above you, but it's not too bad. For the price and amenities, I can't complain in the slightest about a little noise. I heartily recommend this host and room.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"It was a perfect stay !

It was a nice experience, Joe does ask a lot of questions to make sure your trip is going well, so if you're more a private person you'll know. The place is on a top floor without an elevator, so if you have bad knees or some sort, be careful. That's one thing I wasn't expecting as well, but overall it was nice.  Also if you expect to wash clothes, it'll probably be a bit costly. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Fabulous host. Great location with lots of yummy Harlem eats. Breakfast cereal was offered.

It was the cheapest choice I found in the last moment when I decided to spend the night in manhattan , but I tried Airbnb before and tried cheaper but it was super clean with great smells, and it's not hard or expensive to make things clean by simple things. If you are easy to wake up by any voice or sound this is not the perfect choice, cause you will hear loud voices at night coming from the street . If you want to book here, bring your own towels for shower and use after washing hands, the offered is very big and smells bad. The bathroom also wasn't so clean, and no soap to wash hands. My comment is on of dozens comments which mention the lack of clean but it seems the host doesn't want to make a change.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Saw some hairs on the bed linen, there was no bad odor of the sheets though.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Nice place; you pay for what you get.

It's only a 10 or so minute subway journey from broadway which is handy for a theatre nerd like myself. The room itself was on the small side but I expected that from the location and honestly wasn't too bad. If, like myself, you know that you'll be out most of the day and will only be using the house for sleeping and showering, it's perfect. Jj was very accommodating when my flight had some issues meaning I didn't arrive until almost 1am, and he also offered to keep my luggage until my late flight too. He was very communicative through the app and offered me directions for everything and also suggested some day activities for my stay. I would definitely stay here again</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>You get what you pay for. The place isn’t as dirty as it is made out to be from the reviews. The only dirty thing was the overfilled trash all over the kitchen. The room was nicely cleaned and the bed was made. When first walking up the stairs the place looks JANK but don’t be alarmed. Don’t expect to ever actually see Jj. You will hear him through the apartment but as soon as you exit your room he will scurry away. It makes it very awkward. Luckily there is a lock on the door if you’re worried. The room was nice. Small but it had a tv with Hulu/Netflix, closet with extra blankets, and a shelving area to store things. Bed isn’t too bad but it does curve into the middle. Overall it’s an okay place to crash. If you have allergies be WEARY. Although I don’t have any known allergies everytime I entered the area I would get sick with congestion and sore throat. Could be allergies... could also be mold... idk. wouldn’t recommend staying longer than 3-4 nights.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I stayed at Joe's for 5 nights and it was awesome. Upon arrival, he instantly told me about the subway and where to go. Even I was not up for sightseeing back then since I was preparing for school, but it helps me to understand the city better and it will be very easy for me to go around the city since I got the picture. While at his place, I felt comfortable and like at home away from home. Privacy is the utmost concern of Joe. He even offered me to be the audience at a couple of shows but I couldn't make it since I had plans and that were for school preparation. I felt bad for Joe. I'm sorry, really. When my first deal was not successful for the place for me to stay for my school, Joe helped to keep my luggages, big bulky and very heavy, for me for two nights with no charge at all! It was a very pleasant stay. Thank you so much for your hospitality. Now I get the hospitality joke you threw at me upon my arrival the other day. Hope to see you around since I'm gonna be in the city until end of next year. Thank you so much for everything.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Parking was difficult. The garages were full and I had to park two blocks away. Wasn't a bad walk but I felt very out of place walking around the neighborhood. I had to haul my very heavy bags up 5 stories (10 flights of stairs). He was there to let me in and gave me a brief run down and disappeared, not a bad thing, I was tired and wanted privacy and he assured me he was there if I needed him. Room was refreshingly cool from an air-conditioner in the bedroom window. Bathroom was not the cleanest, but not revolting either. It was a nice stay but I would not pay almost $100 to stay there again. Not worth that much, maybe $60 at the most.</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>\"I arrived late at night worsened by flight delays, yet Jj was understanding and helpful with directions around town and to his home; which is at a good location within seconds to public transportation, a minute to a small market that is opened until late and opens early, along with an array of other nearby businesses.

My husband and I stayed here with our 9 month old baby while we were visiting friends in the neighborhood.  It was very convenient to get the stroller in and out of the apartment, and there was the perfect place to keep the stroller inside so we didn't have to fold it up.  Sound carried a little so I felt bad every time my baby cried, but you'll have that anywhere you stay.  The apartment had everything we needed for our three day trip (I was thankful for the hair dryer!); it was very useful to have the kitchen.  Note there is no microwave which didn't matter to us.  Roslyn was so pleasant and easy to work with -  I felt like I'd known her for a long time! We were so thankful to have the extra space for our family (infinitely better than a hotel room).  We were there in December so we didn't use the backyard, but it looked lovely.  </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>We had a wonderful time staying at the apartment. It is spacious, comfortable and well equipped and ideally located for exploring Brooklyn and the rest of NYC being so near to the subway (with easy connections to JFK and Penn Station). It was exceptionally clean and was very welcoming - it was nice to stay somewhere that felt cared for and homely rather than another soulless buy to rent property. I can also honestly say that the bed was the most comfortable I have stayed in at an airbnb property (which helped with jet lag). The garden was beautiful but we didn’t get a chance to use it whilst we were there due to the bad weather. The area feels safe and is quiet with lots of good restaurants and shops nearby. The hosts were friendly and super accommodating (and just upstairs) and made checking in and out easy. Oh, they also have an adorable dog, which is bonus points for me.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"I do not have a bad thing to say about our stay in NYC.

The apartment is clean and well-located. The only thing I would add (I don't mean this in a bad way at all) is it is important for outsiders to realize it is really an excellent functional apartment - it's not a cute romantic getaway, in other words, it's more of an affordable, nice pad from which to explore the city. I would also add for those with bad legs there are some steep stairs entering the place, though nothing too major. In sum, if you're looking for an affordable pad from which to explore the city, it's a good option and Eduardo is a great host.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Nice clean apartment with good access to subways and shops.

The neighborhood wasn't bad, but wouldn't want to hang out there really, we made our way to Williamsburg where we had some friends. \n920930,13244797,2014-05-23,14089920,Simon,\"Pour des raisons indépendantes de notre hôte nous ne l'avons pas rencontré mais il s'est montre disponible et serviable via des SMS</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>Meryl did accommodate us with our early checkin and late checkout, which was helpful. It was raining the first day, and she loaned us a pair of umbrella, which was very kind and she got back to us with questions regarding WiFi, etc immediately. so, overall she was a good host. But, the apartment was dusty and she started sweeping the floors once we checked in.  Also, there were used towels hanging in the bedroom closet, which felt gross.  The kitchen was poorly stocked, there was no coffee maker, which is the least they can do. But, the worst part was the neighborhood. We almost got mugged 1 night around 9 PM coming back to the apt from the subway station. Also, there were parties going outside the apt with loud music until 2 AM, and this made the experience worse, since we wanted to stay, relax and do some sight seeing in NY. This is the first time we tried Airbnb, and unfortunately, it felt like a horrible experience, and we would never use this service again.  The site should do a better job of noting customers about the neighborhood, location, condition of the living space, etc. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Location of the unit near our interview was perfect which was the sole reason for staying in this area.  Michelle's place was spotless and once inside her apartment, we felt safe.   The street and general area of the apartment was grim and out of every window one could see mounds of garbage. It did not smell bad at all insider her unit.  Perhaps much of New York is like this - not sure.  We made sure to be in before dark as the neighborhood seemed a bit rough with much poverty right at the doorstep of the building.  A tip I'd tell people is to bring all your own toiletries.  We had our own shampoo and conditioner, but forgot soap.  I've spoken to friends who've said that a small bar of soap was left on a towel for them and erroneously assumed that we'd see the same.  If you need to be in this area, Michelle is quiet, courteous, respectful and a very nice person.  She's extremely talented and was kind enough to play for us, which she certainly didn't have to do.  Her unit is likely cleaner than most with hardwood sparkling floors and perfectly clean linens.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>It is amazing place for the price. There are 2 subway lines very close to take you right in center of Manhattan. Michelle is very polite and accommodating. Let’s go have your privacy and at the same time is here for you if you need any advice. I traveled a lot and stayed in many guest rooms and this one is my best up to date. Very clean, very cozy! The neighborhood is not to bad considered it’s Bronx. All and all I am so happy I chose to stay with Michelle instead of hotel.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Showed up late and met Scott who was very kind and didn't make me feel bad for doing so. He met me and chatted for 30 mins or so while I had multiple free beers at the check in point. Then walked about 5 blocks and found my apartment which I shared with 5 others (4 in my room including me and 2 in a private room). I was expecting more of a hostel feel but was pleasantly surprised that it was much more intimate. Met some great people from all around the world. My first concern was only 1 bathroom for 6 people but it was not a problem. Other concern is no lockers, but there are cameras in the main room where everybody stores their valuables. I can't speak more since I only spent 6-8 hrs a night sleeping before going back into the concrete jungle. Overall, I would highly recommend this AirBnB and am glad I popped my cherry with it. My first AirBnB will not be my last. Thanks again!!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Rummet är bra och ser ut som på bilden. Sängen är skön. Jag träffade aldrig Gloria men den kommunikation jag hade med henne var utmärkt. Det är rent och välstädat överallt. Bra badrum. Andra rum hyrs också ut men jag träffade knappt dem. Det går att ta sig till Manhattan enkelt med A-linjen. Ännu enklare är det att utforska Brooklyn. Både Williamsburg och Bushwick är hyfsat nära. Området är lugnt men det finns flera trevliga restauranger och kaféer i närheten. Vill man ha ett rum till ett bra pris i ett kvarter där man känna sig som en local och inte turist så är det ett utmärkt val. Jag rekommenderar det varmt.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Johns apartment is unbelievable. I have nothing bad to say about it! The balcony is incredible, especially on a sunny day.

But that's unfair, so I'll say: the place is lovely. Surprisingly spacious  (we've stayed in some cramped apartments and this isn't one), extremely light, quiet, and in a fantastic location. Sandra was extremely helpful - everything was easy. I'm sorry we didn't get to meet her. Easy, inexpensive (by NY standards) parking, great access to public transportation, and everything you'd want within walking distance, anyway. We had just a lovely week.</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>You can't go wrong with Nick and Jim's place.  Its a great location!  Blocks away from all theaters.  The room is cozy and private.

First the instructions to get the keys were extremely vague (had to walk 4 blocks down and explained who we were to a deli guy who wasn't really aware of anything), then we found the room all messy and with previous guests' dirty linens (Seth finally put everything in order), and finally we had to deal with the next guests arrivals while Seth was not there. Seth is obviously very busy, receives a LOT of guests at his place and doesn't give as much care and attention to them as we believed he should.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Seth is really an easy going guy.

Seth is very friendly and sweet,  and he and his bf keep to themselves. I felt very comfortable to come and go. There's a lot to do in the neighbourhood,  but it is also very central for getting around by foot or transit.  I'd recommend this place, unless you have mobility issues,  which would make doing the stairs impossible. I did not find the stairs bad at all, even with a big suitcase.  Also thanks Seth, for recommending the New Museum in your guide book, it was excellent, and I hadn't heard of it otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>An average place. Not much shower pressure, about the bare minimum, if you are staying more than two days you'll miss a good shower. Location not bad, and worked well in a pinch.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>A complete surprise and best value we have ever had in New York City!!!! aside from parking (we had a tall SUV , you will need to secure street parking) but there are parking garages so it's not that bad. The Brooklyn bridge park 1 block away is amazing and the cafe right next to it is amazing. The Dumbo district was a diamond in the ruff. More detailed info on rates for additional guests (states it sleeps 6 but price went up once we informed landlord of an additional guest joining us , wasn't too much but would have been nice to know ahead.) Aside from that all appliances worked great Wifi was fast cable was good water hot and sheets were clean!!! I will be checking this spot again for future trips. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Easy communication, checkin process and thoughtful host, provided a pack n play for my son without my request. The wine bar below the apartment was a little noisy one night but not bad and I’m very sensitive to noise. Apartment was clean and the set up was great! Thank you for a great stay!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location and space are both really nice and as advertised. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with the unit’s shower (the water temperature was scalding hot only and the host’s solution was to turn off the hot water heater). Ultimately, we had to check out early because there was effectively no shower and had to book alternate accommodations. We wish we could give this space a glowing review, but our experience with the bathroom accommodations, and the lack of an adequate solution or refund, left us wishing we had booked elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Sabrina's place has awesome location near Central Park and Columbia University. Place is really small as advertised. But if you aren't ever going to be there it's not bad. Sabrina requires license IDs of each guest staying in the apt. She will not give you a copy of her ID. She has a lot of personality and it was hard to communicate with her at times. But overall she is helpful. </td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I met Natasha's brother a little late my day of arrival but he was very accommodating. The room itself was very nice.

We didn't notice that the sofa was broken (two legs bent on one side) until later. But, it didn't matter as we spent our days exploring Brooklyn and NYC. Chevalia's (on the corner) is amazing, and the apartment is steps away from two great coffee houses - Little Zeldas and Breukelen.

We actually walked from his place to Times Square on our first day! Took us more than an hour but the scenes along the way were worth the sweat! John is so friendly and accommodating. Our arrival flight was delayed and he was still able to wait on us and welcomed us personally. He gives great tips for first timers in New York. He also would check on us daily through here to see if we need anything, I liked it coz it made us feel safe that someone is available  for us just in case.

The space is creative and open with great natural light and was an awesome getaway for a laidback vacation. It's small/narrow, but I had plenty of room. The loft bed was a fun feature if you don't have an issue with heights. Stairs in the building are a bit loud and old. Subway access is a 5-10 minute walk depending on which train you need. Felt safe even late at night coming from the main street on the west end of the block. Travel times on public transit wasn't bad for Manhattan but going over to Brooklyn was a bit longer of a trek (approx. 1 hour). And I'd recommend Uber to/from LGA, unless you want to ride the bus with luggage or risk a less-than-wonderful rideshare shuttle experience. Alix was great, responded quickly, addressed my questions (even adding air conditioning before my arrival), easy and flexible check-in, and wasn't too far in case of emergency. The biggest hiccup during my stay was the tub not draining well, but she informed me of that upon arrival after attempting to fix it.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>The location is great. The value is wonderful. The kitchen is amazing for its size. Brinton is a good host. And his decorating is excellent. I've share a few tips with him for better use of the space. Talk him into replacing the double bed with a queen-sized bed. And adding a dresser. The place needs dresser drawers badly. I showed him how to make those pieces of furniture fit very comfortably. The place a walk-up. First walk down a few steps, then up two flights, not just one from first floor to second floor, but two. Nonetheless, the location and value is tremendous, and the studio is comfortable and quiet. Thanks, Brinton!</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>Thank you very much for a great stay.

But then 42nd Street a couple of blocks west of Times Sq. wasn't all that safe. New York has come a long way in 25 years.

The floor looks messy, but it wasn't actually that dirty or anything I think. The room itself is a wooden structure with plywood walls and no windows -- it could not even be described as a 0 star hotel room so just keep your expectations in line. The only towel provided was bigger than a wash cloth but smaller than a typical bath towel. There was some kind of wooden structure at the front that may be furniture in progress, I'm not sure, but it didn't take up much space. Accuracy: The photos are okay. The description of the broader loft was reasonable. The listing said that there was natural light, so I assumed there was a window in the room itself, in the part not shown in the photos. There are no windows nor any natural light in the room itself. It is surrounded by wooden panels with a low ceiling (less than 6' I'd estimate) so it made me feel claustrophobic, and there wasn't much ventilation (there was just a fan there). I think the host meant that natural light gets into the loft itself, but it's important to be accurate. Most importantly, it wasn't explicitly stated that the door to the room is at the edge of the platform (with no guardrails or anything). If you're groggy in the mornings or at night or have drank and you climb up the ladder to go to the room, it would not be hard to take one wrong step, fall and break a few things or even die. It's at least 8 feet high I would say. As this could be life-threatening, it's important to mention explicitly to be really careful. Check-In: It took a few minutes to find the place, but the instructions were okay. As soon as I got in, I noticed there were no windows and no natural light and thus that the description had misled me. So I requested to cancel 3 of the 4 planned day stay. The host got my request and messaged me that one night wasn't enough due to his costs for cleaning and his taxis to come to the place at some point earlier. I said that I felt claustrophobic and probably wouldn't be able to sleep there, but would try it out for a night. The host did offer me a bed by a window, but that wasn't really a room, just a bed by a window. I said it would be hard for me to sleep out in the open with the light and noise, but I could try it for a night. I said I still tentatively wanted to cancel the other 3 days as I was doubtful it would work. The host then messaged that one night wouldn't cover his cost for buying sheets for me and taxi costs. The sheets on the bed didn't look terrible, but definitely did not look brand new. I found the host's messages about cleaning (didn't look like much cleaning was done but it was okay), new sheets, then the request to text me outside of AirBnb dodgy, so I then offered to leave without staying at all if so much effort was put into cleaning and one night wouldn't be sufficient to make up for it all. The host never really tried to make things work besides initially offering me the bed by the window which again I said I could try. The host offered to refund 2 days if I would never stay in the place. I didn't agree to that -- I think I have 48 hours to cancel so I should have been able to cancel 2 nights and still stay 2 nights if I wanted though I'm not sure. Please note I booked this just twelve hours earlier in the day (not weeks in advance). Since the host wasn't really offering or accepting anything, I called Airbnb support. Airbnb said they would take care of me, but never clarified what that meant. The host said he was calling Airbnb too. Later on after talking to the host a lot, Airbnb told me I would get a full refund including the Airbnb fees and that I should leave. At that point, the host began messaging me that I need to leave immediately and that he was sending a friend over to make sure I wasn't taking anything -- insinuating that I was a thief or something (no, I had no intention to take his giant photo of an erection and there wasn't much else in the loft but art on the walls). This was 11:30 pm at night after 1+ hours of trying to figure something out that the host and Airbnb put me in the street (no option was given to even stay one night), this after a 12 hour international flight which the host knew about. The host's roommate and an artist, (or if the host doesn't live there, his friend who lives there) Flash is really nice and he was the only person (not the host, not Airbnb) who offered an apology when I left for the whole situation and that I was rudely messaged or sent to the streets so late and tired. Communication: It took over an hour for the host and AirBnb to figure out something. I immediately as soon as I got into the room didn't think it would work but was willing to try both options offered by the host for a night as described earlier. I would guess that the host and AirBnb were trying to figure out how to try to keep all my money, then decided they couldn't as the description did have an inaccuracy, then finally refunded it to me after over an hour of me just waiting. This is again my guess. I will note I have been to hundreds of hotels & homestays around the...</td></tr><tr><td>wrong</td><td>Place was great. Ahmed could have handled resolution of a problem differently but in the end I hope everything is settled. Be sure to let the host know if anything goes wrong as soon as it does, and just in life don't make assumptions.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>There not a bad word I can say about Ahmed’s place! Communication is instant, and his lovely apartment is ideal for any one visiting NYC. I loved every minute of my stay and would recommend it to everyone!  Ahmed’s is a great guy and helped me so much during my stay.</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>\"Emily & Lou saved my New York trip, I had bad luck with a previous host and they took me to their home in very last minute booking. Neighborhood was comfy and had lot's of stuff to do and places to eat. Their home was clean and cute, even if I had a shared room, I felt private and I had my own space. I got everything I needed and they had maps and an awesome book about New York.  Lou made me breakfast every morning and I loved those smoothies, so good. I got many good tips to what to do and got some awesome introductions on how to get around.\n1016004,15659924,2014-07-13,17573923,Emilia,\"They were the best hosts.

He always asked if all was well. The location is excellent, very nice neighborhood and close to train stations. The room was Okey with a beautiful view to the garden. The bathroom wasn't very clean, but not too bad considering that we were 4 guests using it.\n1023181,577639136,2019-12-15,32406102,Linda,A very friendly host and wonderful conversationalist!  Staying with Mitty felt more like visiting a friend's home than a stranger's home.\n1023181,582119563,2019-12-26,50544846,Sally,\"Mitty is a very interactive host</td></tr><tr><td>bad</td><td>I had a great time staying with the Perez family.  They were very welcoming and excellent hosts.  The space is large and clean.  It is located a block and a half from the 1 train at 137th, which is very convenient.  If you are worried about the neighborhood, being that it is Harlem (even though Harlem really isn't that bad), I felt very safe.  I am from Brooklyn and know trouble when I see it; this area was not bad at all.  Thanks Perez family, see you guys next time!</td></tr><tr><td>worse</td><td>I stayed at Kyla's place for roughly ~2 1/2 months over the summer to do an internship in Dumbo and by far it was the best summer i've ever had. Now that is partly because New York is an unbelievable city, but it is also due to the fact that with this Airbnb rental you get much more than a place to stay. I met some of the most wonderful people through my roomates. 2 rooms in the upper house and 1 in the lower get rented out to Airbnb travelers (sometimes it's more sometimes less) so there's never a shortage of fascinating international nomads to hang out with. The permanent residents were so nice as well-introducing me to all their friends, taking me out, making fantastic dinners, throwing parties, going to cool events, etc. The room I stayed in was incredibly spacious for the price (and, I mean, it's New York) and included lots of storage space, a surpisingly clean bathroom, a highly effective air conditioner (thank god), a queen bed with sheets and pillows, 2 adorable cats (that you don't have to see if you don't want to, they mainly hang out in the backyard or the lower house), and some very wacky posters and paintings. The house itself is very cozy and well furnished. The washer and dryer in the house is a godsend and the fridge and cupboards have plenty of space for your food. The nearest train is the L and it's a bit of a walk (~10 min), the other trains (J & M) are farther. But that's because it's Brooklyn, meaning it's more spread out and less industrial but with that you get less noise, less tomfoolery, and honestly what seemed like a very family oriented area. Bushwick is incredibly diverse and much safer than I expected, as long as you keep to yourself. Keep in mind it's a bit of a schlep to get to most of manhattan (~40 min) and a bit worse if you work in Dumbo/Brooklyn heights like I did. But the commute never bothered me because the pro's of this rental and this city far outweighed the cons. My stay really couldn't have gone any better. It's cliché, but if I could do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":51},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql \n\n-- exploding multi values
